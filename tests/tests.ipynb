The process typically involves mixing ingredients like flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, and a leavening agent (like baking powder) to create a batter, then baking it in the oven at a controlled temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, \"cooking\" a cake can refer to some alternative methods, especially if you don’t have an oven. Here are a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Microwave Cake: You can make mug cakes by combining a small portion of cake batter in a mug and microwaving it for a minute or so. Microwave cakes cook quickly but tend to be denser than oven-baked cakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stovetop Cake: Using a heavy pan or a skillet, you can cook a cake on the stovetop. Often, a pot or a Dutch oven is used to simulate oven-like conditions. You'll need low, even heat and might need to flip the cake midway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steamed Cake: In some cuisines, cakes are steamed rather than baked. The batter is placed in a pan, which is then set in a steamer. This method results in a moist, soft cake and is often used for specific cake recipes, like Chinese sponge cakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slow Cooker Cake: A slow cooker can also be used to “bake” a cake by cooking it on low heat over a long period, resulting in a soft, tender cake. This method works particularly well for dense cakes, like chocolate lava cake or pudding cake.\n",

My contact information is available on the PIRLS website. If you don't want to reach out to anyone else directly or you can reach out to the English hubs directly. But I'm happy to really relay questions as needed if there are questions after the fact. I know not everyone. If you can attend in real time. Are there any other questions from the audience we have at the moment? Well, in the absence of any questions posted, then, in the last five minutes, I suppose I'll open up the floor in case any of the. Of my co-presenters here have any questions for one another or kind of final thoughts to share. In addition to anything that you said, you don't don't have to tack anything on here, but you're more than welcome if you have kind of final reflection that you think we didn't draw out somewhere else. I'll open the floor. Thank you. Can I just come in and just say one final thing? Of course you can.

I think I'm handing over to Ariel now. Thank you. Thanks just before I go over to questions we do have a couple of really good questions and I want to make sure we do. I wanted to take a moment to express my really deep appreciation for everyone who's contributed to this symposium because I think you know as I said earlier but it really can't be said enough the most that we can do in research like PIRLS is identify patterns and without kind of reflecting on what that means for practice you know the value of that research really isn't isn't capitalised on. So I really appreciate the efforts that we've made to work together here and I really appreciate the presentations that everyone's given on the kind of possible why and what next. So let's without further ado we could go to questions I'm just going to publish the two that are up and encourage people who are in attendance to add any questions to the queue that you might have in the order then in which they came. Hopefully those are available now. There was one question I think for Matthew if I could just put you up on what work you actually could do around that you mentioned around kind of reading in the home. Yep so. We've done lots of work in supporting our parents and carers to understand our approach to reading both in terms of the phonics element but also our reading learning.

And there are differences, of course, between strategies for older students, not the strategies themselves, but how you deal with older students, etc. So it's worth getting involved and signing up for those webinars because they'll be coming out. In the next few weeks. Thank you. Thank you. That's really useful. And I think hopefully this is helpful to have drawn drawn out some really specific actions that people can take and information that they can access as kind of next steps.

The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed in 2021. 21 of the 32 countries that had comparable trend data between those assessments showed declines between 2016 and 2021. Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education.

So that's really just the sort of, just a really quick sort of run through some of the possible reasons for those findings in that decline around confidence and engagement and enjoyment. And I think I'm going to pass the baton on to now, to Matthew now to introduce us to some of the things that we've been talking about in the past. Matthew, I think you've got a lot of information about the role of reading in the reading culture.

Reflecting on the findings, we've been thinking about the work we're doing at Chesston Primary School, which is where the Wanderl English Hub is based in London. We've reflected on research from Professor Tareeta Kremen at the Open University and her colleagues there, as well as more recently the reading frameworks from the DfE and the guidance involved in there, and really thought about practical things we could implement in the reading culture.

And so the development of reading as a complex skill is where we need to be looking at building upon this to get those great outcomes in readers. And as I've said fundamentally it's a whole school, it's all leaders, it's a strategy and so schools need to build that strategy into the very fabric of daily life in the schools. So we're going to hand on now to think a little bit more about that culture and how you might achieve that. Hi, yes so I hope everyone can hear me. So as we've heard, despite really encouraging outcome linked to reading performance, there were some less positive responses relating to reading confidence, enjoyment and engagement. And I think if we can move on to the next slide please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next slide in our presentation we can see here the report from the CLPE which was based on approximately 800 responses. And you can see from some of the extracts here from the report considers the missed opportunities really for schools to create those communities of readers and and to immerse pupils in positive literary experiences due to the lockdown as being a possible contributing factor to a reduction in reading confidence, enjoyment and engagement.

So welcome. We're looking to what we can learn from PIRLS 2021 and in particular making a sense of not just the research findings, but some reflections on them from kind of thinking about practice in schools in England from the perspective of the English Hubs. So thank you for being with us and thank you to the presenters who are contributing today from the English Hubs. We'll start with an overview of key findings from PIRLS in England, a little bit about what the study was and what we found in it, and then I'll hand over to some leads from English Hubs to reflect on why the findings might be what they were and really what next for people working in schools. What are the implications? What are the implications for practice and what do the findings mean practically? So just a few acknowledgements about the study, because PIRLS internationally is quite a complex type of a piece of research. The international study is led across a large number of countries, and we'll talk a bit more about that by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, and directed in particular by the TIMSS and PIRLS.

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read.

Yep so. We've done lots of work in supporting our parents and carers to understand our approach to reading both in terms of the phonics element but also our reading learning. So we've done lots of work in supporting our parents and carers to understand our approach to reading both in terms of the phonics element but also our reading reading for pleasure approach. So we've run workshops we've invited parents in and we also organise trips to the local library very lucky it's very close to our school and we sign every child up for a library card. We then promote we encourage the parents to visit the library to access that free resource which we hope in turn then encourages reading at home. But it's really I think about sharing our approach and encouraging adults in the home to model that reading for pleasure and talk to their child about books. So rather than kind of asking perhaps more formal teacher kind of type comprehension questions having a chat about the book relating to the child's experience raising some of the texts that they've read has made the difference. I'm sure across the English Hubs there's lots of great work being done to engage families and parents and carers in their child's reading journey too. And there's another question which I think also probably was from your section Matthew so I'll leave you up but if you want to go on to the next slide. Okay.

Now it is a moderate association. It's it's the. Yeah. It's a good correlation to be seen and the first thing we just wanted to do here was just sort of think of ideas as to why that is and I don't think anybody would disagree with the fact that when children start their reading journey more confidently and schools are supporting those children, you know, with practicing fluency and so they're taking them beyond year one and.\n",

The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more.

And it was the same with the students. All the students who had not been admitted to the test, had not been able to go to the test for the any sort of concerns from students about participating or issues during test delivery. So on the whole, the experience of participation was quite smooth in terms of what schools got in order to in exchange for participating. There was a personalized report for each participating school that gave results where it was possible to do so without undue disclosure about individual students or groups of students, where we gave a two page summary of key findings from the study overall, but then also personalized report of results for that school to sort of prompt reflections and give some feedback on what the results were within that school. So a lot of that focused on attitudes to reading and percentage of pupils meeting certain benchmarks, which we'll touch on in more detail in a bit nationally. We welcome Pearson and Oxford input about what schools might appreciate receiving for taking part in studies like this in the future, because obviously that's always.\n",

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

I mean, again, I can say to my own practice, we see this that as soon as we get going with children, we have a nursery. And as soon as we prioritise reading and storytelling and enjoyment of reading, I won't go on to that because the other group's going to do that, but it all has an impact on confidence. So where does that confidence begin and how do we ensure that we're getting the right information? And how do we ensure that we're getting the right information? And how do we ensure that we're getting the right information? And how do we ensure that confidence is maintained? So phonics allows us to really focus in on reading, to take it seriously, to make sure that we are getting all children to read. And if we're doing that well, that confidence for those children means that they can access other areas of the curriculum. They have the skills to read and it will take them through their reading journey. Ariel, next slide. Now, this is interesting because although the English Hub programme haven't, been involved in lots of data studies, we are gathering masses of data because we're involved deeply with so many schools, thousands of schools, and we're getting out into those schools and we're getting a lot of information. And that information basically is backing up some of these findings that are coming from the PIRLS study. So, for example, I've just taken one example there because I was.\n",

One of the things we spent a lot of time on is really carefully thinking about the book selection is really carefully thinking about the book selection we have available, or the text selection, that we have available to children within the classroom, within the school library and the books in the wider reading environment in schools that we have available, we have available to children within the classroom, within the school library and the books in the wider reading environment in school.

Directed by the Tims and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, PIRLS has monitored trends in reading achievement around the world since 2001, gathering high-quality data that policymakers and educators use to make evidence-based decisions about reading curricula and instruction. PIRLS 2021 was the fifth cycle of PIRLS, providing 20 years of trend data monitoring progress in students' reading achievement at the fourth grade. PIRLS provides critical information about students' reading skills in today's information society. Technology has changed almost everything about the way we live and communicate. Reading, often online, requires sorting useful, valuable information from the data that we collect. The data that we collect is often used to help us understand what we're reading, and to help us understand what we're reading. Reading is a way of learning from useless information and comprehending what's meaningful to accomplish goals. PIRLS 2021 is the only international assessment of educational achievement that collected data during COVID-19's disruption in student schooling.

Are there any other questions from the audience we have at the moment? Well, in the absence of any questions posted, then, in the last five minutes, I suppose I'll open up the floor in case any of the.

I wanted to take a moment to express my really deep appreciation for everyone who's contributed to this symposium because I think you know as I said earlier but it really can't be said enough the most that we can do in research like PIRLS is identify patterns and without kind of reflecting on what that means for practice you know the value of that research really isn't isn't capitalised on. So I really appreciate the efforts that we've made to work together here and I really appreciate the presentations that everyone's given on the kind of possible why and what next. So let's without further ado we could go to questions I'm just going to publish the two that are up and encourage people who are in attendance to add any questions to the queue that you might have in the order then in which they came. Hopefully those are available now. There was one question I think for Matthew if I could just put you up on what work you actually could do around that you mentioned around kind of reading in the home. Yep so.

Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed in 2021. 21 of the 32 countries that had comparable trend data between those assessments showed declines between 2016 and 2021. Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement.

So that's really just the sort of, just a really quick sort of run through some of the possible reasons for those findings in that decline around confidence and engagement and enjoyment. And I think I'm going to pass the baton on to now, to Matthew now to introduce us to some of the things that we've been talking about in the past. Matthew, I think you've got a lot of information about the role of reading in the reading culture.

Reflecting on the findings, we've been thinking about the work we're doing at Chesston Primary School, which is where the Wanderl English Hub is based in London. We've reflected on research from Professor Tareeta Kremen at the Open University and her colleagues there, as well as more recently the reading frameworks from the DfE and the guidance involved in there, and really thought about practical things we could implement in the reading culture.

And so the development of reading as a complex skill is where we need to be looking at building upon this to get those great outcomes in readers. And as I've said fundamentally it's a whole school, it's all leaders, it's a strategy and so schools need to build that strategy into the very fabric of daily life in the schools. So we're going to hand on now to think a little bit more about that culture and how you might achieve that. Hi, yes so I hope everyone can hear me. So as we've heard, despite really encouraging outcome linked to reading performance, there were some less positive responses relating to reading confidence, enjoyment and engagement. And I think if we can move on to the next slide please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next slide in our presentation we can see here the report from the CLPE which was based on approximately 800 responses. And you can see from some of the extracts here from the report considers the missed opportunities really for schools to create those communities of readers and and to immerse pupils in positive literary experiences due to the lockdown as being a possible contributing factor to a reduction in reading confidence, enjoyment and engagement.

So welcome. We're looking to what we can learn from PIRLS 2021 and in particular making a sense of not just the research findings, but some reflections on them from kind of thinking about practice in schools in England from the perspective of the English Hubs. So thank you for being with us and thank you to the presenters who are contributing today from the English Hubs. We'll start with an overview of key findings from PIRLS in England, a little bit about what the study was and what we found in it, and then I'll hand over to some leads from English Hubs to reflect on why the findings might be what they were and really what next for people working in schools. What are the implications? What are the implications for practice and what do the findings mean practically? So just a few acknowledgements about the study, because PIRLS internationally is quite a complex type of a piece of research. The international study is led across a large number of countries, and we'll talk a bit more about that by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, and directed in particular by the TIMSS and PIRLS.

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read.

Yep so. We've done lots of work in supporting our parents and carers to understand our approach to reading both in terms of the phonics element but also our reading learning. So we've done lots of work in supporting our parents and carers to understand our approach to reading both in terms of the phonics element but also our reading reading for pleasure approach. So we've run workshops we've invited parents in and we also organise trips to the local library very lucky it's very close to our school and we sign every child up for a library card. We then promote we encourage the parents to visit the library to access that free resource which we hope in turn then encourages reading at home. But it's really I think about sharing our approach and encouraging adults in the home to model that reading for pleasure and talk to their child about books. So rather than kind of asking perhaps more formal teacher kind of type comprehension questions having a chat about the book relating to the child's experience raising some of the texts that they've read has made the difference. I'm sure across the English Hubs there's lots of great work being done to engage families and parents and carers in their child's reading journey too. And there's another question which I think also probably was from your section Matthew so I'll leave you up but if you want to go on to the next slide. Okay.

Now it is a moderate association. It's it's the. Yeah. It's a good correlation to be seen and the first thing we just wanted to do here was just sort of think of ideas as to why that is and I don't think anybody would disagree with the fact that when children start their reading journey more confidently and schools are supporting those children, you know, with practicing fluency and so they're taking them beyond year one and.\n",

The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more.

And it was the same with the students. All the students who had not been admitted to the test, had not been able to go to the test for the any sort of concerns from students about participating or issues during test delivery. So on the whole, the experience of participation was quite smooth in terms of what schools got in order to in exchange for participating. There was a personalized report for each participating school that gave results where it was possible to do so without undue disclosure about individual students or groups of students, where we gave a two page summary of key findings from the study overall, but then also personalized report of results for that school to sort of prompt reflections and give some feedback on what the results were within that school. So a lot of that focused on attitudes to reading and percentage of pupils meeting certain benchmarks, which we'll touch on in more detail in a bit nationally. We welcome Pearson and Oxford input about what schools might appreciate receiving for taking part in studies like this in the future, because obviously that's always.\n",

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

I mean, again, I can say to my own practice, we see this that as soon as we get going with children, we have a nursery. And as soon as we prioritise reading and storytelling and enjoyment of reading, I won't go on to that because the other group's going to do that, but it all has an impact on confidence. So where does that confidence begin and how do we ensure that we're getting the right information? And how do we ensure that we're getting the right information? And how do we ensure that we're getting the right information? And how do we ensure that confidence is maintained? So phonics allows us to really focus in on reading, to take it seriously, to make sure that we are getting all children to read. And if we're doing that well, that confidence for those children means that they can access other areas of the curriculum. They have the skills to read and it will take them through their reading journey. Ariel, next slide. Now, this is interesting because although the English Hub programme haven't, been involved in lots of data studies, we are gathering masses of data because we're involved deeply with so many schools, thousands of schools, and we're getting out into those schools and we're getting a lot of information. And that information basically is backing up some of these findings that are coming from the PIRLS study. So, for example, I've just taken one example there because I was.\n",

One of the things we spent a lot of time on is really carefully thinking about the book selection is really carefully thinking about the book selection we have available, or the text selection, that we have available to children within the classroom, within the school library and the books in the wider reading environment in schools that we have available, we have available to children within the classroom, within the school library and the books in the wider reading environment in school.

      "source: [\"PIRLS 2021– Findings, IEA Education\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D1RnQhyAZU), content: IEA's PIRLS is the global standard for monitoring reading achievement at the fourth grade. Directed by the Tims and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, PIRLS has monitored trends in reading achievement around the world since 2001, gathering high-quality data that policymakers and educators use to make evidence-based decisions about reading curricula and instruction. PIRLS 2021 was the fifth cycle of PIRLS, providing 20 years of trend data monitoring progress in students' reading achievement at the fourth grade. PIRLS provides critical information about students' reading skills in today's information society. Technology has changed almost everything about the way we live and communicate. Reading, often online, requires sorting useful, valuable information from the data that we collect. The data that we collect is often used to help us understand what we're reading, and to help us understand what we're reading. Reading is a way of learning from useless information and comprehending what's meaningful to accomplish goals. PIRLS 2021 is the only international assessment of educational achievement that collected data during COVID-19's disruption in student schooling. Due to tremendous efforts by the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries and eight benchmarking participants over nearly a two-year period, about 400,000 students were assessed. The PIRLS assessment is available online, and the 600,000 students will read with data from 25 times over the по Alles明白. These has\n",
      "        And add in the final answer all the sources (unique i.e. only once) of the relevant pieces of this knowledge if it was useful.\n",
      "        \n",
      "When applicable, search for relevant data in the PIRLS 2021 dataset. You are free to use duckduckgo to find additional information about PIRLS 2021 dataset.\n",
      "When answering, always:     - Always answer the question precisely and then explain or provide evidence or elaborate on your answer\n",
      "    Example:\n",
      "        when asked about somparison of kids possessing or not possessing tablets show the average score in those 2 groups. Only then you can show comparison between countries etc.\n",
      "- When asked about topics from outside the area of your expertise, kindly answer in the first place that it's not your task and area of expertise. Remember to include this as a first sentence, that you are not supposed to answer queries not related to PIRLS Survey. Be concise. Just inform about that. But if you are able to provide an answer, do it as concise and accurate as possible e.g. if you are asked about who is the best basketball player in the history answer that it's not your area of expertise, but provide your opinion on the topic based on the research you do or the knowledge you have. Be concise! Your area of expertise is whatever is included in PIRLS 2021 survey. Be careful, different topics like Covid-19 are there. Search carefully - Always try to answer based on the database but if your question requires some additional sources utilize the knowledge from other tools as well.  - Ensure that your analysis is accurate and relevant to the research questions. - Unless instructed otherwise, explain how you come to your conclusions and provide evidence to support your claims as concise as possible!!! - Always try to present the results in a table format. You can use some additional metrics. You can use multiple tables if it's appropriate. Be clear with the column names. DO NOT BE AFRAID OF PRESENTING THE DATA up to 100 rows. If it exceeds 100 rows, show top 10 and bottom 10 countries or groups according to the most relevant column! Top and bottom countries should be shown in separate tables.  - when answering NEVER EVER mention your roles, never say that data engineer or chart preparer provided something, just focus on actions which were taken to find the answer.Provide answer and refer to the PIRLS survey as your source. - Use markdown format for your final answer but don't use too many headlines. If you want to make a headline use rather ### instead of #. Don't bold the text too much, just the very essential staff. - Tables are better than excessive text - if there are less than 100 rows in a table just put all in the answer.  - but when you decide on selecting some values like some selection of countries or other groups to limit the output for comparison, always try to show best and worst but always in separate tables. Don't mix in one table best and worst unless you show all the groups. Sort top value sin descending order and lowest values in ascending. Try to show between 5 and 10 top and bottom values.\n",
