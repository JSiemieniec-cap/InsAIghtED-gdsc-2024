Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be.

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news. In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this.\n",

There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

PIRLS reported achievement at four international benchmarks. Low, intermediate, high, and advanced. Students reaching the low benchmark could read straightforward texts. In contrast, the advanced benchmark is a very high target. The small percentages of students reaching the advanced benchmark, 7% or less in the majority of countries, could integrate ideas and evaluate relatively complex texts with abstract or technical concepts. There was nearly universal literacy in the 43 PIRLS 2021 countries that managed to collect achievement data on schedule.

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read.

The majority of these countries had 94% or more of their students reaching the low benchmark, demonstrating they could read relatively uncomplicated materials. The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed.\n",

So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances. In a study like this, but knowing broad patterns can help to prompt useful reflections and further questions about practice and policy. So just very important to bear in mind in thinking about the findings. Because of COVID, not all countries can be directly compared to one another. But in PROL's 2021, we look at 43 countries that tested at the same or a similar age. And so when you see rankings, that's what's being compared. And the countries that tested at a slightly older age are being excluded from those comparisons. Trends over time are a bit more complicated too because of COVID-19 and because of the impact on the study. So with that, all of that preface, key findings, what you will have probably seen in the media, if you encountered PROL's findings in the media, was something about overall reading performance in England and how that compared internationally. So the average score in England was 558 compared to an international median of 520. So overall, quite high average reading performance. The score from PROL's 2021 was not significantly below the previous cycle score. So it was one point below. It was not a significant or meaningful drop. England ranked fourth amongst the 43 countries that could be compared directly, or in other words that tested at a similar age. And only three countries saw a.\n",

So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit. And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive. Over time, in terms of responses to whether their teachers give them interesting things to read. That gives us some sense of the patterns, and then time spent reading outside of school isn't quite an attitude, but a behavior in relation to reading where we see a lower proportion of pupils spending less than 30 minutes reading outside of school. But we see a reduction, particularly for girls in the time spent reading outside of school, over Pearl's time. Helen and Keyakter.

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

Directed by the Tims and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, PIRLS has monitored trends in reading achievement around the world since 2001, gathering high-quality data that policymakers and educators use to make evidence-based decisions about reading curricula and instruction. PIRLS 2021 was the fifth cycle of PIRLS, providing 20 years of trend data monitoring progress in students' reading achievement at the fourth grade. PIRLS provides critical information about students' reading skills in today's information society. Technology has changed almost everything about the way we live and communicate. Reading, often online, requires sorting useful, valuable information from the data that we collect. The data that we collect is often used to help us understand what we're reading, and to help us understand what we're reading. Reading is a way of learning from useless information and comprehending what's meaningful to accomplish goals. PIRLS 2021 is the only international assessment of educational achievement that collected data during COVID-19's disruption in student schooling. Due to tremendous efforts by the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries and eight benchmarking participants over nearly a two-year period, about 400,000 students were assessed. The PIRLS assessment is available online, and the 600,000 students will read with data from 25 times over the по Alles明白. These has.\n",

This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in terms of trends over time where questionnaire items have changed, but there's some sense that the percentage of pupils disagreeing that reading was easy for them increased, which basically raises a question of kind of, is reading less easy for pupils? So that's one key finding to highlight that we unpack a little bit. And the bits that follow this overview. Similarly, liking of reading, higher liking of reading tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores, which again, probably is unsurprising. In England, about 29% of pupils very much liked reading, 48% somewhat liked reading, and 24% did not like reading. Low levels of reading enjoyment were fairly common in higher performing education systems, and culturally, similar English-speaking education systems. So England wasn't completely unique in that sort of pattern. A larger proportion of boys in England did not like reading. And again, we can't do too much with trends over time, but girls and boys seem to be less likely to strongly agree that they enjoyed reading. So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit..\n",

Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed in 2021. 21 of the 32 countries that had comparable trend data between those assessments showed declines between 2016 and 2021. Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. It's a key to fostering students' early literacy skills.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading achievement at the fourth grade. Most parents reported engaging their children in early literacy activities before primary school, such as reading books and telling stories. Parents were also asked how well their children could perform early literacy tasks when beginning primary school. The students who could do early literacy tasks very well had higher reading achievement than those who could do the literacy tasks moderately well or not well. Parents' degree of reading enjoyment was associated with their children's reading achievement. However, more than two-thirds of the students had parents who only somewhat like or do not like to read. Supportive school environments facilitate reading achievement. As an indicator of school's socioeconomic level, PIRLS asked school principals to estimate the percentage of economically affluent and economically disadvantaged students in the school. Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages,.\n",

Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group as originally intended. So that was in England year five. And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact. We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind.

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because.

And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's.

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news. In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this.\n",

So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals.

The majority of these countries had 94% or more of their students reaching the low benchmark, demonstrating they could read relatively uncomplicated materials. The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed.\n",

So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances. In a study like this, but knowing broad patterns can help to prompt useful reflections and further questions about practice and policy. So just very important to bear in mind in thinking about the findings. Because of COVID, not all countries can be directly compared to one another. But in PROL's 2021, we look at 43 countries that tested at the same or a similar age. And so when you see rankings, that's what's being compared. And the countries that tested at a slightly older age are being excluded from those comparisons. Trends over time are a bit more complicated too because of COVID-19 and because of the impact on the study. So with that, all of that preface, key findings, what you will have probably seen in the media, if you encountered PROL's findings in the media, was something about overall reading performance in England and how that compared internationally. So the average score in England was 558 compared to an international median of 520. So overall, quite high average reading performance. The score from PROL's 2021 was not significantly below the previous cycle score. So it was one point below. It was not a significant or meaningful drop. England ranked fourth amongst the 43 countries that could be compared directly, or in other words that tested at a similar age. And only three countries saw a.\n",

So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit. And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive. Over time, in terms of responses to whether their teachers give them interesting things to read. That gives us some sense of the patterns, and then time spent reading outside of school isn't quite an attitude, but a behavior in relation to reading where we see a lower proportion of pupils spending less than 30 minutes reading outside of school. But we see a reduction, particularly for girls in the time spent reading outside of school, over Pearl's time. Helen and Keyakter.

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

Directed by the Tims and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, PIRLS has monitored trends in reading achievement around the world since 2001, gathering high-quality data that policymakers and educators use to make evidence-based decisions about reading curricula and instruction. PIRLS 2021 was the fifth cycle of PIRLS, providing 20 years of trend data monitoring progress in students' reading achievement at the fourth grade. PIRLS provides critical information about students' reading skills in today's information society. Technology has changed almost everything about the way we live and communicate. Reading, often online, requires sorting useful, valuable information from the data that we collect. The data that we collect is often used to help us understand what we're reading, and to help us understand what we're reading. Reading is a way of learning from useless information and comprehending what's meaningful to accomplish goals. PIRLS 2021 is the only international assessment of educational achievement that collected data during COVID-19's disruption in student schooling. Due to tremendous efforts by the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries and eight benchmarking participants over nearly a two-year period, about 400,000 students were assessed. The PIRLS assessment is available online, and the 600,000 students will read with data from 25 times over the по Alles明白. These has.\n",

This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in terms of trends over time where questionnaire items have changed, but there's some sense that the percentage of pupils disagreeing that reading was easy for them increased, which basically raises a question of kind of, is reading less easy for pupils? So that's one key finding to highlight that we unpack a little bit. And the bits that follow this overview. Similarly, liking of reading, higher liking of reading tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores, which again, probably is unsurprising. In England, about 29% of pupils very much liked reading, 48% somewhat liked reading, and 24% did not like reading. Low levels of reading enjoyment were fairly common in higher performing education systems, and culturally, similar English-speaking education systems. So England wasn't completely unique in that sort of pattern. A larger proportion of boys in England did not like reading. And again, we can't do too much with trends over time, but girls and boys seem to be less likely to strongly agree that they enjoyed reading. So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit..\n",

Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed in 2021. 21 of the 32 countries that had comparable trend data between those assessments showed declines between 2016 and 2021. Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. It's a key to fostering students' early literacy skills. Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading.\n",

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading achievement at the fourth grade. Most parents reported engaging their children in early literacy activities before primary school, such as reading books and telling stories. Parents were also asked how well their children could perform early literacy tasks when beginning primary school. The students who could do early literacy tasks very well had higher reading achievement than those who could do the literacy tasks moderately well or not well. Parents' degree of reading enjoyment was associated with their children's reading achievement. However, more than two-thirds of the students had parents who only somewhat like or do not like to read. Supportive school environments facilitate reading achievement. As an indicator of school's socioeconomic level, PIRLS asked school principals to estimate the percentage of economically affluent and economically disadvantaged students in the school. Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages,.\n",

Tested the same pupils as originally intended or the same cohort of pupils as originally intended at a slightly older age, which is relevant to reading performance. Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group as originally intended. So that was in England year five. And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact. We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind. And in general, we can't really interpret results as assessing any particular policy in England or anywhere else. So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances.

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one.\n",

But we are seeing a link and what we are sort of, again, we'll come to what schools are telling us, but the question is, if we get the phonics teaching right and it's taken seriously and prioritised, is that going to have an effect on the reading journey for a child as a whole? And then in general, higher confidence, again, coming to this idea of confidence, when does confidence begin? I mean, again, I can say to my own practice, we see this that as soon as we get going with children, we have a nursery. And as soon as we prioritise reading and storytelling and enjoyment of reading, I won't\n",

For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed.\n",

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be.

There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so relevant to England's results particularly because England continued to use paper along with slightly more than half the participating countries. And rather, whereas all of the MSP assessments did child or adult care and at least all footcare services, really low answered crosslit. There was a transition from the 2021 to the 2021 for prep and med.

We're also risk margin for sustainability, and test of community success is particularly common. So, there's information amongst students who now really like PIRLS, digital pearls data could be linked to the overall trends from previous cycles. So there's a lot of technical kind of work that goes on there behind the scenes to be able to establish trends where the assessment has changed from paper to digital, but in England it's remained paper over all of the cycles to date. The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where.\n",

We welcome Pearson and Oxford input about what schools might appreciate receiving for taking part in studies like this in the future, because obviously that's always something we want to think quite a lot about in this sort of research. So just a quick note to say if you have thoughts about what schools should receive in exchange for participating in studies like this, we are quite keen to learn from you what you think would be valuable. And to bear that in mind towards future research. And a few contexts and cautions, and I know there's a lot of preface here, but it's very important to bound how we interpret results from studies of this nature than really of any research. So the impact of COVID-19 is highly relevant here, both on data collection where, although the majority of countries continued with data collection as originally planned, 14 countries delayed by 6 months, and the impact of COVID-19 on the population is highly relevant. So we're going to look at the overall timeline of the study. So the overall timeline of the study is really important to bear in mind.

Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group.\n",

In terms of gaps between the highest and the lowest performing pupils, where here we're talking about sort of for lower performing pupils, 10th percentile and below. For higher performing pupils, we're talking about 90th percentile and above. So the very bottom and the very top sort of ends of the distribution. There's I have the table of performance on average at those percentiles and above and below. In general, the pattern is that gaps tend to be larger in lower performing countries and smaller and higher performing countries. And I noted earlier on that in England, historically, there's been a substantial gap long term looking at the trends for the highest and the lowest performing groups. Like there's a reduction of the gap in England that seems to be, broadly speaking, over time, a result more of increases for the lowest performing pupils than it is of a decrease for the highest performing pupils. And the reason that I say that a bit cautiously there, as you can see, if you look at the graph on the right from 2016 to 2021, there is a little bit of a reduction. In the. In the. In the. In the graph on the left, you can see that the gap between the highest performing pupils average performance, but that's a very small decrease.

So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances. In a study like this, but knowing broad patterns can help to prompt useful reflections and further questions about practice and policy. So just very important to bear in mind in thinking about the findings. Because of COVID, not all countries can be directly compared to one another. But in PROL's 2021, we look at 43 countries that tested at the same or a similar age. And so when you see rankings, that's what's being compared. And the countries that tested at a slightly older age are being excluded from those comparisons. Trends over time are a bit more complicated too because of COVID-19 and because of the impact on the study. So with that, all of that preface, key findings, what you will have probably seen in the media, if you encountered PROL's findings in the media, was something about overall reading performance in England and how that compared internationally. So the average score in England was 558 compared to an international median of 520. So overall, quite high average reading performance. The score from PROL's 2021 was not significantly below the previous cycle score. So it was one point below. It was not a significant or meaningful drop. England ranked fourth amongst the 43 countries that could be compared directly, or in other words that tested at a similar age. And only three countries saw a.\n",

And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

PIRLS 2021 was the fifth cycle of PIRLS, providing 20 years of trend data monitoring progress in students' reading achievement at the fourth grade. PIRLS provides critical information about students' reading skills in today's information society. Technology has changed almost everything about the way we live and communicate. Reading, often online, requires sorting useful, valuable information from the data that we collect. The data that we collect is often used to help us understand what we're reading, and to help us understand what we're reading. Reading is a way of learning from useless information and comprehending what's meaningful to accomplish goals.

We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind. And in general, we can't really interpret results as assessing any particular policy in England or anywhere else. So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances. In a study like this, but knowing broad patterns can help to prompt useful reflections and further questions about practice and.\n",

But England's high performance isn't really a matter of just having excluded countries that delayed by a different amount and tested a slightly older group of pupils. International benchmarks. So I'll put these up. There's quite a lot of text here, but I won't read this out, but I'll leave just a moment for people to read these benchmarks in brief. This kind of contextualizes what the different levels of performance or what the different benchmarks are defined as, which might be useful if you're thinking from a kind of perspective of practice in England or about curriculum in England. You can sort of reflect on how some of this aligns. So I'll leave a brief moment for that. This is another약 har And with In Perils 2021 southwestern Pick� im Thanks. Our authorities have identified the bench n that are and they're consistent with pararloquist were larger proportions of pupils performing at the high and advanced. So here that's in yellow and green, or green and yellow in the order that I said them, high and advanced. Higher proportions of pupils in England performing at the high and advanced benchmarks than was the case internationally, the international median. There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed.

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one.\n",

The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed in 2021. 21 of the 32 countries that had comparable trend data between those assessments showed declines between 2016 and 2021. Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. It's a key to fostering students' early literacy skills. Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading.\n",

The project delivery in England was led not by Oxford, but by Pearson and by Associate Professor Dr Grace Grima at Pearson. The research team at Oxford was responsible for the analysis contributing to the national report and to other outputs from the project. And I wanted to especially thank the other researchers who contributed to that report and to the other bits of analysis that we're doing around that. So a bit of a structure to the research findings here. There is a lot of content. These are really just key findings, so I'll signpost at the end where you can find more information if you're interested. But we'll hit the highlights in this session. So just to give a bit of context for what PIRLS is as a research study so that we can make sense of the results. So a little textbook is Give us brief an introduction as I can well giving enough information, PIRLS is progress in international reading literacy study. It assesses and compares the reading performance of pupils approximately ten years of age across about sixty education systems or countries. The number of countries participating does vary. A bit between cycles and PR RLS but perils has been conducted every five years sinceos. PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in.\n",

In England, the corresponding numbers are there were about 4,150 pupils, 178 teachers and 162 schools and headteachers. So it gives you a sense of the size of the study. A few patterns from previous cycles of PIRLS in England just to be mindful of in thinking about what the results were from the 2021 cycle. Historically, England has seen significantly higher overall performance in PIRLS compared to the international median, an increase in the average score on PIRLS from 2006 onwards, a larger than average gain. So, again, this is a very large gap between the highest and lowest performing pupils looking internationally and a larger gender gap than in many education systems, particularly in 2011. So, sort of some general comparisons just historically before the 2021 cycle in England compared to other participating countries. A couple of particular features from the 2021 study, again, internationally, but very relevant to England's participation in PIRLS, just to bear in mind for people who are quite interested in sort of what underlies the research results. There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so.\n",

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",

There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

So it was one point below. It was not a significant or meaningful drop. England ranked fourth amongst the 43 countries that could be compared directly, or in other words that tested at a similar age. And only three countries saw a significant increase since the previous cycle where they participated in 2016 and again in the 2021 cycle. So not decreasing was actually quite an encouraging result in England where the majority of participating countries that had participated previously saw significant decreases. And that's important point. So there's something about resilience to the impact of COVID-19 there in people's reading overall. In terms of trends over time, there's not too much more to say there except that of the countries that did delay by six months and test a slightly older age group, there wasn't a strong pattern there of any sort. They were about split half and half above and below the international median. So actually there's not too much to add from comparing those, but we're not able to really make a direct comparison where six months is a substantial amount more potential learning in reading. So that's why we don't make that comparison.

So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils.

We welcome Pearson and Oxford input about what schools might appreciate receiving for taking part in studies like this in the future, because obviously that's always something we want to think quite a lot about in this sort of research. So just a quick note to say if you have thoughts about what schools should receive in exchange for participating in studies like this, we are quite keen to learn from you what you think would be valuable. And to bear that in mind towards future research. And a few contexts and cautions, and I know there's a lot of preface here, but it's very important to bound how we interpret results from studies of this nature than really of any research. So the impact of COVID-19 is highly relevant here, both on data collection where, although the majority of countries continued with data collection as originally planned, 14 countries delayed by 6 months, and the impact of COVID-19 on the population is highly relevant.

For higher performing pupils, we're talking about 90th percentile and above. So the very bottom and the very top sort of ends of the distribution. There's I have the table of performance on average at those percentiles and above and below. In general, the pattern is that gaps tend to be larger in lower performing countries and smaller and higher performing countries. And I noted earlier on that in England, historically, there's been a substantial gap long term looking at the trends for the highest and the lowest performing groups. Like there's a reduction of the gap in England that seems to be, broadly speaking, over time, a result more of increases for the lowest performing pupils than it is of a decrease for the highest performing pupils.

In a study like this, but knowing broad patterns can help to prompt useful reflections and further questions about practice and policy. So just very important to bear in mind in thinking about the findings. Because of COVID, not all countries can be directly compared to one another. But in PROL's 2021, we look at 43 countries that tested at the same or a similar age. And so when you see rankings, that's what's being compared. And the countries that tested at a slightly older age are being excluded from those comparisons. Trends over time are a bit more complicated too because of COVID-19 and because of the impact on the study. So with that, all of that preface, key findings, what you will have probably seen in the media, if you encountered PROL's findings in the media, was something about overall reading performance in England and how that compared internationally. So the average score in England was 558 compared to an international median of 520. So overall, quite high average reading performance. The score from PROL's 2021 was not significantly below the previous cycle score. So it was one point below. It was not a significant or meaningful drop.

And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

Directed by the Tims and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, PIRLS has monitored trends in reading achievement around the world since 2001, gathering high-quality data that policymakers and educators use to make evidence-based decisions about reading curricula and instruction. PIRLS 2021 was the fifth cycle of PIRLS, providing 20 years of trend data monitoring progress in students' reading achievement at the fourth grade. PIRLS provides critical information about students' reading skills in today's information society. Technology has changed almost everything about the way we live and communicate. Reading, often online, requires sorting useful, valuable information from the data that we collect. The data that we collect is often used to help us understand what we're reading, and to help us understand what we're reading. Reading is a way of learning from useless information and comprehending what's meaningful to accomplish goals. PIRLS 2021 is the only international assessment of educational achievement that collected data during COVID-19's disruption in student schooling. Due to tremendous efforts by the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries and eight benchmarking participants over nearly a two-year period, about 400,000 students were assessed. The PIRLS assessment is available online, and the 600,000 students will read with data from 25 times over the по Alles明白. These has.\n",

Tested the same pupils as originally intended or the same cohort of pupils as originally intended at a slightly older age, which is relevant to reading performance. Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group as originally intended. So that was in England year five. And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact. We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind. And in general, we can't really interpret results as assessing any particular policy in England or anywhere else. So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances.

So I'll put these up. There's quite a lot of text here, but I won't read this out, but I'll leave just a moment for people to read these benchmarks in brief. This kind of contextualizes what the different levels of performance or what the different benchmarks are defined as, which might be useful if you're thinking from a kind of perspective of practice in England or about curriculum in England. You can sort of reflect on how some of this aligns. So I'll leave a brief moment for that. This is another약 har And with In Perils 2021 southwestern Pick� im Thanks. Our authorities have identified the bench n that are and they're consistent with pararloquist were larger proportions of pupils performing at the high and advanced. So here that's in yellow and green, or green and yellow in the order that I said them, high and advanced. Higher proportions of pupils in England performing at the high and advanced benchmarks than was the case internationally, the international median. There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed.

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one.\n",

The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed in 2021. 21 of the 32 countries that had comparable trend data between those assessments showed declines between 2016 and 2021. Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. It's a key to fostering students' early literacy skills. Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading.\n",

The project delivery in England was led not by Oxford, but by Pearson and by Associate Professor Dr Grace Grima at Pearson. The research team at Oxford was responsible for the analysis contributing to the national report and to other outputs from the project. And I wanted to especially thank the other researchers who contributed to that report and to the other bits of analysis that we're doing around that. So a bit of a structure to the research findings here. There is a lot of content. These are really just key findings, so I'll signpost at the end where you can find more information if you're interested. But we'll hit the highlights in this session. So just to give a bit of context for what PIRLS is as a research study so that we can make sense of the results. So a little textbook is Give us brief an introduction as I can well giving enough information, PIRLS is progress in international reading literacy study. It assesses and compares the reading performance of pupils approximately ten years of age across about sixty education systems or countries. The number of countries participating does vary. A bit between cycles and PR RLS but perils has been conducted every five years sinceos. PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in.\n",

In England, the corresponding numbers are there were about 4,150 pupils, 178 teachers and 162 schools and headteachers. So it gives you a sense of the size of the study. A few patterns from previous cycles of PIRLS in England just to be mindful of in thinking about what the results were from the 2021 cycle. Historically, England has seen significantly higher overall performance in PIRLS compared to the international median, an increase in the average score on PIRLS from 2006 onwards, a larger than average gain. So, again, this is a very large gap between the highest and lowest performing pupils looking internationally and a larger gender gap than in many education systems, particularly in 2011. So, sort of some general comparisons just historically before the 2021 cycle in England compared to other participating countries. A couple of particular features from the 2021 study, again, internationally, but very relevant to England's participation in PIRLS, just to bear in mind for people who are quite interested in sort of what underlies the research results. There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so.\n",

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",

There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

So it was one point below. It was not a significant or meaningful drop. England ranked fourth amongst the 43 countries that could be compared directly, or in other words that tested at a similar age. And only three countries saw a significant increase since the previous cycle where they participated in 2016 and again in the 2021 cycle. So not decreasing was actually quite an encouraging result in England where the majority of participating countries that had participated previously saw significant decreases. And that's important point. So there's something about resilience to the impact of COVID-19 there in people's reading overall. In terms of trends over time, there's not too much more to say there except that of the countries that did delay by six months and test a slightly older age group, there wasn't a strong pattern there of any sort. They were about split half and half above and below the international median. So actually there's not too much to add from comparing those, but we're not able to really make a direct comparison where six months is a substantial amount more potential learning in reading. So that's why we don't make that comparison. But England's high performance isn't really a matter of just having excluded countries that delayed by a different amount and tested a slightly older group of pupils. International benchmarks.

There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so relevant to England's results particularly because England continued to use paper along with slightly more than half the participating countries.

Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education.

In England, the corresponding numbers are there were about 4,150 pupils, 178 teachers and 162 schools and headteachers. So it gives you a sense of the size of the study. A few patterns from previous cycles of PIRLS in England just to be mindful of in thinking about what the results were from the 2021 cycle. Historically, England has seen significantly higher overall performance in PIRLS compared to the international median, an increase in the average score on PIRLS from 2006 onwards, a larger than average gain. So, again, this is a very large gap between the highest and lowest performing pupils looking internationally and a larger gender gap than in many education systems, particularly in 2011. So, sort of some general comparisons just historically before the 2021 cycle in England compared to other participating countries.

Directed by the Tims and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, PIRLS has monitored trends in reading achievement around the world since 2001, gathering high-quality data that policymakers and educators use to make evidence-based decisions about reading curricula and instruction. PIRLS 2021 was the fifth cycle of PIRLS, providing 20 years of trend data monitoring progress in students' reading achievement at the fourth grade. PIRLS provides critical information about students' reading skills in today's information society. Technology has changed almost everything about the way we live and communicate. Reading, often online, requires sorting useful, valuable information from the data that we collect. The data that we collect is often used to help us understand what we're reading, and to help us understand what we're reading. Reading is a way of learning from useless information and comprehending what's meaningful to accomplish goals. PIRLS 2021 is the only international assessment of educational achievement that collected data during COVID-19's disruption in student schooling.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

Now it is a moderate association. It's it's the. Yeah. It's a good correlation to be seen and the first thing we just wanted to do here was just sort of think of ideas as to why that is and I don't think anybody would disagree with the fact that when children start their reading journey more confidently and schools are supporting those children, you know, with practicing fluency and so they're taking them beyond year one and.\n",

And it was the same with the students. All the students who had not been admitted to the test, had not been able to go to the test for the any sort of concerns from students about participating or issues during test delivery. So on the whole, the experience of participation was quite smooth in terms of what schools got in order to in exchange for participating. There was a personalized report for each participating school that gave results where it was possible to do so without undue disclosure about individual students or groups of students, where we gave a two page summary of key findings from the study overall, but then also personalized report of results for that school to sort of prompt reflections and give some feedback on what the results were within that school. So a lot of that focused on attitudes to reading and percentage of pupils meeting certain benchmarks, which we'll touch on in more detail in a bit nationally. We welcome Pearson and Oxford input about what schools might appreciate receiving for taking part in studies like this in the future, because obviously that's always.\n",

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read.

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news. In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this.\n",

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be.

And so passing the PSE is not enough. Actually what you really wanting to do is to get those children not just passing with the pass mark but getting that accuracy, those really high scores, and then taking them into fluency. But you'll find that there's a lot of confusion around what we mean by fluency. Does it just mean reading independently? Does it mean reading an age appropriate book as people might see it in an independent way? But actually, as you can see, you've got to start to unpick fluency, you've got to look at accuracy and the rate of reading, you've got to look at that expression and awareness of the audience and you've got to get that comprehension, that cognition about what they're reading. And so the development of reading as a complex skill is where we need to be looking at building upon this to get those great outcomes in readers..\n",

The project delivery in England was led not by Oxford, but by Pearson and by Associate Professor Dr Grace Grima at Pearson. The research team at Oxford was responsible for the analysis contributing to the national report and to other outputs from the project. And I wanted to especially thank the other researchers who contributed to that report and to the other bits of analysis that we're doing around that. So a bit of a structure to the research findings here. There is a lot of content. These are really just key findings, so I'll signpost at the end where you can find more information if you're interested. But we'll hit the highlights in this session. So just to give a bit of context for what PIRLS is as a research study so that we can make sense of the results. So a little textbook is Give us brief an introduction as I can well giving enough information, PIRLS is progress in international reading literacy study. It assesses and compares the reading performance of pupils approximately ten years of age across about sixty education systems or countries. The number of countries participating does vary. A bit between cycles and PR RLS but perils has been conducted every five years sinceos. PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in.\n",

There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

In terms of gaps between the highest and the lowest performing pupils, where here we're talking about sort of for lower performing pupils, 10th percentile and below. For higher performing pupils, we're talking about 90th percentile and above. So the very bottom and the very top sort of ends of the distribution. There's I have the table of performance on average at those percentiles and above and below. In general, the pattern is that gaps tend to be larger in lower performing countries and smaller and higher performing countries. And I noted earlier on that in England, historically, there's been a substantial gap long term looking at the trends for the highest and the lowest performing groups. Like there's a reduction of the gap in England that seems to be, broadly speaking, over time, a result more of increases for the lowest performing pupils than it is of a decrease for the highest performing pupils. And the reason that I say that a bit cautiously there, as you can see, if you look at the graph on the right from 2016 to 2021, there is a little bit of a reduction. In the. In the. In the. In the graph on the left, you can see that the gap between the highest performing pupils average performance, but that's a very small decrease.

Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group as originally intended. So that was in England year five. And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact. We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind. And in general, we can't really interpret results as assessing any particular policy in England or anywhere else. So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances.

So just a quick note to say if you have thoughts about what schools should receive in exchange for participating in studies like this, we are quite keen to learn from you what you think would be valuable.

All the students who had not been admitted to the test, had not been able to go to the test for the any sort of concerns from students about participating or issues during test delivery. So on the whole, the experience of participation was quite smooth in terms of what schools got in order to in exchange for participating. There was a personalized report for each participating school that gave results where it was possible to do so without undue disclosure about individual students or groups of students, where we gave a two page summary of key findings from the study overall, but then also personalized report of results for that school to sort of prompt reflections and give some feedback on what the results were within that school. So a lot of that focused on attitudes to reading and percentage of pupils meeting certain benchmarks, which we'll touch on in more detail in a bit nationally. We welcome Pearson and Oxford input about what schools might appreciate receiving for taking part in studies like this in the future, because obviously that's always.\n",
      "source: [\"PIRLS 2021– Findings, IEA Education\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D1RnQhyAZU), content: Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read. This video presents highlights of reading achievement in PIRLS 2021 and an.\n",

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news. In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this.\n",

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading.\n",

And so passing the PSE is not enough. Actually what you really wanting to do is to get those children not just passing with the pass mark but getting that accuracy, those really high scores, and then taking them into fluency. But you'll find that there's a lot of confusion around what we mean by fluency. Does it just mean reading independently? Does it mean reading an age appropriate book as people might see it in an independent way? But actually, as you can see, you've got to start to unpick fluency, you've got to look at accuracy and the rate of reading, you've got to look at that expression and awareness of the audience and you've got to get that comprehension, that cognition about what they're reading. And so the development of reading as a complex skill is where we need to be looking at building upon this to get those great outcomes in readers..\n",

The project delivery in England was led not by Oxford, but by Pearson and by Associate Professor Dr Grace Grima at Pearson. The research team at Oxford was responsible for the analysis contributing to the national report and to other outputs from the project. And I wanted to especially thank the other researchers who contributed to that report and to the other bits of analysis that we're doing around that. So a bit of a structure to the research findings here. There is a lot of content. These are really just key findings, so I'll signpost at the end where you can find more information if you're interested. But we'll hit the highlights in this session. So just to give a bit of context for what PIRLS is as a research study so that we can make sense of the results. So a little textbook is Give us brief an introduction as I can well giving enough information, PIRLS is progress in international reading literacy study. It assesses and compares the reading performance of pupils approximately ten years of age across about sixty education systems or countries. The number of countries participating does vary. A bit between cycles and PR RLS but perils has been conducted every five years sinceos. PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in.\n",

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

In terms of gaps between the highest and the lowest performing pupils, where here we're talking about sort of for lower performing pupils, 10th percentile and below. For higher performing pupils, we're talking about 90th percentile and above. So the very bottom and the very top sort of ends of the distribution. There's I have the table of performance on average at those percentiles and above and below. In general, the pattern is that gaps tend to be larger in lower performing countries and smaller and higher performing countries. And I noted earlier on that in England, historically, there's been a substantial gap long term looking at the trends for the highest and the lowest performing groups. Like there's a reduction of the gap in England that seems to be, broadly speaking, over time, a result more of increases for the lowest performing pupils than it is of a decrease for the highest performing pupils. And the reason that I say that a bit cautiously there, as you can see, if you look at the graph on the right from 2016 to 2021, there is a little bit of a reduction. In the. In the. In the. In the graph on the left, you can see that the gap between the highest performing pupils average performance, but that's a very small decrease.

Tested the same pupils as originally intended or the same cohort of pupils as originally intended at a slightly older age, which is relevant to reading performance. Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group as originally intended. So that was in England year five. And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact. We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind. And in general, we can't really interpret results as assessing any particular policy in England or anywhere else. So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances.

Around that very outer edge is the mention of reading teachers and it was found in this project that some not all but some of the teachers developed as reading teachers where they were. Teachers who read themselves and readers who teach. On these slides and I'm not sure if these are going to be distributed but there is a link to a video where Teresa Kremin herself and a practitioner who took part in this research talk a bit more in depth about how she as a teacher became a teacher who reads and a reader who teaches and it might be worth having a look if you have some time outside of this symposium.

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read.

We can say what's happening on average, but actually making some meaning of that towards what happens in schools and what happens in policy is, you know, that requires some discussion and that requires a bit more thought. So the point of today really is to hand over and let the English Hubs leads who have agreed to contribute to this session think about actually what do those results mean? Where have they come from? And so what? So we have two key themes that we've focused on and you'll hear a bit about each of these. One is the correlation with phonics screening check scores and the other concerns people attitudes around reading. So I will. End there and hand over so that we can hear more about that.

We welcome Pearson and Oxford input about what schools might appreciate receiving for taking part in studies like this in the future, because obviously that's always something we want to think quite a lot about in this sort of research. So just a quick note to say if you have thoughts about what schools should receive in exchange for participating in studies like this, we are quite keen to learn from you what you think would be valuable. And to bear that in mind towards future research. And a few contexts and cautions, and I know there's a lot of preface here, but it's very important to bound how we interpret results from studies of this nature than really of any research. So the impact of COVID-19 is highly relevant here, both on data collection where, although the majority of countries continued with data collection as originally planned, 14 countries delayed by 6 months, and the impact of COVID-19 on the population is highly relevant. So we're going to look at the overall timeline of the study. So the overall timeline of the study is really important to bear in mind.

And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact. We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind. And in general, we can't really interpret results as assessing any particular policy in England or anywhere else. So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances.

Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed in 2021. 21 of the 32 countries that had comparable trend data between those assessments showed declines between 2016 and 2021. Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. It's a key to fostering students' early literacy skills.

I think once teachers have got this enriched repertoire of children's literature and got to know the interests the practices of their young readers in their class which will differ year upon year the research found they were far more able to skillfully match books and make recommendations to those children. And so it'd be interesting to reflect as a school on how well your staff know children's literature and know the children in their class and their likes and dislikes. Looking at the central part of the diagram through the teachers as readers project a reading for pleasure pedagogy was developed. And that's the middle bit of this diagram encompassed planning time for reading aloud independent reading and book talk and recommendations and all of these are within the content context of a social reading environment which is also mentioned in the reading framework. You can see here why again that knowledge that teachers have of children's texts and children as readers is so important in making this a success but what was found is that these alone. These things is not enough and is dependent on to what extent these practices are what is referred to as wrist which you can see across the middle of the diagram which stands for reader led. Informal social and then with text that tempt the children. Around that very outer edge is the mention of reading teachers and it was found in this project that some not all but some of the teachers developed as reading.\n",

So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit. And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive. Over time, in terms of responses to whether their teachers give them interesting things to read. That gives us some sense of the patterns, and then time spent reading outside of school isn't quite an attitude, but a behavior in relation to reading where we see a lower proportion of pupils spending less than 30 minutes reading outside of school. But we see a reduction, particularly for girls in the time spent reading outside of school, over Pearl's time. Helen and Keyakter.

I'm going to highlight a couple of the core strategies that are mentioned in that section eight of the reading framework that you as teachers and senior leaders could implement in your school if you don't already and they probably will echo some of the examples that Matthew just gave us from his fantastic presentation. But the first part here so an example of the small part struck a little bit in that would be I think that it wouldектив. Genon cell temperature that we would want to allow some sort of normal cell temperature. We found with Covid-19 schools maybe we teach an alternate module. It would be kind of something similar but we would also like to comedy. Should we just started moving on? books to be read to children across time and that reading aloud is just as important in key stage two and key stage three where sometimes I think we can see that the idea of story time and teacher reading dropping off a little. Another strategy that's mentioned in the framework is time for informal book talk including giving recommendations as an adult and peers giving recommendations to each other through book clubs and that time that book club time needs to be protected on the timetable so that teachers can promote books and pupils can make.\n",

In England, the corresponding numbers are there were about 4,150 pupils, 178 teachers and 162 schools and headteachers. So it gives you a sense of the size of the study. A few patterns from previous cycles of PIRLS in England just to be mindful of in thinking about what the results were from the 2021 cycle. Historically, England has seen significantly higher overall performance in PIRLS compared to the international median, an increase in the average score on PIRLS from 2006 onwards, a larger than average gain. So, again, this is a very large gap between the highest and lowest performing pupils looking internationally and a larger gender gap than in many education systems, particularly in 2011. So, sort of some general comparisons just historically before the 2021 cycle in England compared to other participating countries. A couple of particular features from the 2021 study, again, internationally, but very relevant to England's participation in PIRLS, just to bear in mind for people who are quite interested in sort of what underlies the research results. There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so.\n",

In terms of gaps between the highest and the lowest performing pupils, where here we're talking about sort of for lower performing pupils, 10th percentile and below. For higher performing pupils, we're talking about 90th percentile and above. So the very bottom and the very top sort of ends of the distribution. There's I have the table of performance on average at those percentiles and above and below. In general, the pattern is that gaps tend to be larger in lower performing countries and smaller and higher performing countries. And I noted earlier on that in England, historically, there's been a substantial gap long term looking at the trends for the highest and the lowest performing groups. Like there's a reduction of the gap in England that seems to be, broadly speaking, over time, a result more of increases for the lowest performing pupils than it is of a decrease for the highest performing pupils. And the reason that I say that a bit cautiously there, as you can see, if you look at the graph on the right from 2016 to 2021, there is a little bit of a reduction. In the. In the. In the. In the graph on the left, you can see that the gap between the highest performing pupils average performance, but that's a very small decrease.

Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading achievement at the fourth grade. Most parents reported engaging their children in early literacy activities before primary school, such as reading books and telling stories. Parents were also asked how well their children could perform early literacy tasks when beginning primary school. The students who could do early literacy tasks very well had higher reading achievement than those who could do the literacy tasks moderately well or not well. Parents' degree of reading enjoyment was associated with their children's reading achievement. However, more than two-thirds of the students had parents who only somewhat like or do not like to read. Supportive school environments facilitate reading achievement. As an indicator of school's socioeconomic level, PIRLS asked school principals to estimate the percentage of economically affluent and economically disadvantaged students in the school. Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages,.\n",

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

Informal social and then with text that tempt the children. Around that very outer edge is the mention of reading teachers and it was found in this project that some not all but some of the teachers developed as reading teachers where they were. Teachers who read themselves and readers who teach. On these slides and I'm not sure if these are going to be distributed but there is a link to a video where Teresa Kremin herself and a practitioner who took part in this research talk a bit more in depth about how she as a teacher became a teacher who reads and a reader who teaches and it might be worth having a look if you have some time outside of this symposium. The teachers that. Did perform in that way. Were found to be. Open up in class and in which the development of reading communities by sharing their personal responses with the children. And then you've got the far outer section of the diagram which highlights the importance of reading communities. They'll be different. They'll be differently shaped in every classroom. There might be different year upon year depending on the children as they respond to all stakeholders who are involved in that reading practice. So that's the young people in front of the teachers. The teachers any other additional adults and also the parents of those children. True communities of engaged readers are characterized through the research as being reciprocal and.\n",

It's building confidence. And we can almost say it's almost as the teachers build their own authorial confidence. And we can also say that the teachers are doing the research in the books that they're using, the research in the authors, et cetera, that that is also having an impact on the spoken language, because we're recognising that we have to talk about what we read. It's not just enough just to read. The children then need to have that opportunity. And so that leads us into this idea that you really need a whole school reading culture, and it can't just come from individual teachers or reading leaders. It has to come from the teachers. And so I think that's a really important point. It's as far as where the background and the curriculum goes, we're talking about really how we learn to read and still deal with the classroom. I'm actually still going to get some more correr with my screen, but really, I've got to relate to when we say you want to learn to read Dick's BMC and what he's trying to say to students when there are 67 words in front of read. And with the logr mari intensive the mostistle, that you come to that pleasant insight of a simple little story that they said as they are mad to here and now, I'm writing for a group. If.\n",

We then also use that to encourage them to read aloud, so that they can read aloud, and then we've moved it to encourage book chat, so we might model that as an adult and with another adult in the class, but also engage in book chat with children in our in our own classes too. And crucially both of these elements have again, as I mentioned earlier, relied on us as adults knowing children's literature really well, but also knowing our children's readers really well, so what books they might like, what books they might like to enjoy. On the next slide there's just a link to a website from the Open University with some more examples of practice, so practical things that schools can do to embed that reading for pleasure culture within their settings. I think I'm having a tell now for the next slide. Thank you Matthew, if I could have the next slide please. Thank you, so I've been given the tough job in this next slide of discussing some further research that highlights quite a bleak picture with regards to children's attitudes and the motivation for reading, and it's the findings of the National Literacy Trust. So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

So this document is a very important piece of information for teachers to be able to understand the teaching of reading including us who are English hubs. It provides guidance on how reading should be taught in primary schools and outlines some of the different challenges of teaching reading in the secondary curriculum and provides support for secondary schools in teaching pupils who have not yet met those expectations in reading. So it has lots of aims but one of them the one pertinent to what myself and my colleagues are talking about today is in section eight of the reading framework where the aim is to support schools in motor school and in teaching reading. So we're going to be looking at some of the key strategies that are mentioned in section eight of the reading framework that we've heard from teachers and the leaders of our schools in motivating pupils to develop that love of reading.

The majority of these countries had 94% or more of their students reaching the low benchmark, demonstrating they could read relatively uncomplicated materials. The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed.\n",

There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

We've had to make sure that our teachers and our colleagues have a really good knowledge of children's literature and that isn't just books but also comics, graphic novels, really think about the diversity of genre we have on offer to our pupils and think about poetry, non-fiction and other text types as well as digital text. We've spent a lot of time ensuring that the books that children have access to in the classroom, in the school library are of really high quality and relate to their interests. We've also thought about, and Liz mentioned some research from CLPE, another piece of work they've done around reflecting realities and thinking about how the children within our school and wider society are reflected in the books that we read. So we thought really carefully about ethnic diversity within the books, we thought about ensuring the books have characters with disabilities and different family groups, and we thought about how we could use the books to really bring people together and really have a good discussion about the different types of children within the books, and all different kinds of factors to make sure that the children feel really reflected within the books they read, which really boosted their\n",

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read.

We can say what's happening on average, but actually making some meaning of that towards what happens in schools and what happens in policy is, you know, that requires some discussion and that requires a bit more thought. So the point of today really is to hand over and let the English Hubs leads who have agreed to contribute to this session think about actually what do those results mean? Where have they come from? And so what? So we have two key themes that we've focused on and you'll hear a bit about each of these.

We welcome Pearson and Oxford input about what schools might appreciate receiving for taking part in studies like this in the future, because obviously that's always something we want to think quite a lot about in this sort of research. So just a quick note to say if you have thoughts about what schools should receive in exchange for participating in studies like this, we are quite keen to learn from you what you think would be valuable. And to bear that in mind towards future research. And a few contexts and cautions, and I know there's a lot of preface here, but it's very important to bound how we interpret results from studies of this nature than really of any research. So the impact of COVID-19 is highly relevant here, both on data collection where, although the majority of countries continued with data collection as originally planned, 14 countries delayed by 6 months, and the impact of COVID-19 on the population is highly relevant. So we're going to look at the overall timeline of the study. So the overall timeline of the study is really important to bear in mind.

And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact. We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind. And in general, we can't really interpret results as assessing any particular policy in England or anywhere else. So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances.

The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed in 2021. 21 of the 32 countries that had comparable trend data between those assessments showed declines between 2016 and 2021. Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. It's a key to fostering students' early literacy skills.

I think once teachers have got this enriched repertoire of children's literature and got to know the interests the practices of their young readers in their class which will differ year upon year the research found they were far more able to skillfully match books and make recommendations to those children. And so it'd be interesting to reflect as a school on how well your staff know children's literature and know the children in their class and their likes and dislikes. Looking at the central part of the diagram through the teachers as readers project a reading for pleasure pedagogy was developed. And that's the middle bit of this diagram encompassed planning time for reading aloud independent reading and book talk and recommendations and all of these are within the content context of a social reading environment which is also mentioned in the reading framework. You can see here why again that knowledge that teachers have of children's texts and children as readers is so important in making this a success but what was found is that these alone. These things is not enough and is dependent on to what extent these practices are what is referred to as wrist which you can see across the middle of the diagram which stands for reader led. Informal social and then with text that tempt the children. Around that very outer edge is the mention of reading teachers and it was found in this project that some not all but some of the teachers developed as reading.\n",

So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit. And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive. Over time, in terms of responses to whether their teachers give them interesting things to read. That gives us some sense of the patterns, and then time spent reading outside of school isn't quite an attitude, but a behavior in relation to reading where we see a lower proportion of pupils spending less than 30 minutes reading outside of school. But we see a reduction, particularly for girls in the time spent reading outside of school, over Pearl's time. Helen and Keyakter.

There will be some webinars around this from the department for education coming out shortly too which will give much more detail for you as schools and I recommend that you watch out for those. I'm going to highlight a couple of the core strategies that are mentioned in that section eight of the reading framework that you as teachers and senior leaders could implement in your school if you don't already and they probably will echo some of the examples that Matthew just gave us from his fantastic presentation. But the first part here so an example of the small part struck a little bit in that would be I think that it wouldектив.

It would be kind of something similar but we would also like to comedy. Should we just started moving on? books to be read to children across time and that reading aloud is just as important in key stage two and key stage three where sometimes I think we can see that the idea of story time and teacher reading dropping off a little. Another strategy that's mentioned in the framework is time for informal book talk including giving recommendations as an adult and peers giving recommendations to each other through book clubs and that time that book club time needs to be protected on the timetable so that teachers can promote books and pupils can make.\n",

In England, the corresponding numbers are there were about 4,150 pupils, 178 teachers and 162 schools and headteachers. So it gives you a sense of the size of the study. A few patterns from previous cycles of PIRLS in England just to be mindful of in thinking about what the results were from the 2021 cycle. Historically, England has seen significantly higher overall performance in PIRLS compared to the international median, an increase in the average score on PIRLS from 2006 onwards, a larger than average gain. So, again, this is a very large gap between the highest and lowest performing pupils looking internationally and a larger gender gap than in many education systems, particularly in 2011. So, sort of some general comparisons just historically before the 2021 cycle in England compared to other participating countries. A couple of particular features from the 2021 study, again, internationally, but very relevant to England's participation in PIRLS, just to bear in mind for people who are quite interested in sort of what underlies the research results. There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so.\n",

In terms of gaps between the highest and the lowest performing pupils, where here we're talking about sort of for lower performing pupils, 10th percentile and below. For higher performing pupils, we're talking about 90th percentile and above. So the very bottom and the very top sort of ends of the distribution. There's I have the table of performance on average at those percentiles and above and below. In general, the pattern is that gaps tend to be larger in lower performing countries and smaller and higher performing countries. And I noted earlier on that in England, historically, there's been a substantial gap long term looking at the trends for the highest and the lowest performing groups. Like there's a reduction of the gap in England that seems to be, broadly speaking, over time, a result more of increases for the lowest performing pupils than it is of a decrease for the highest performing pupils. And the reason that I say that a bit cautiously there, as you can see, if you look at the graph on the right from 2016 to 2021, there is a little bit of a reduction. In the. In the. In the. In the graph on the left, you can see that the gap between the highest performing pupils average performance, but that's a very small decrease.

Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading achievement at the fourth grade. Most parents reported engaging their children in early literacy activities before primary school, such as reading books and telling stories. Parents were also asked how well their children could perform early literacy tasks when beginning primary school. The students who could do early literacy tasks very well had higher reading achievement than those who could do the literacy tasks moderately well or not well. Parents' degree of reading enjoyment was associated with their children's reading achievement. However, more than two-thirds of the students had parents who only somewhat like or do not like to read. Supportive school environments facilitate reading achievement. As an indicator of school's socioeconomic level, PIRLS asked school principals to estimate the percentage of economically affluent and economically disadvantaged students in the school. Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages,.\n",

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

Around that very outer edge is the mention of reading teachers and it was found in this project that some not all but some of the teachers developed as reading teachers where they were. Teachers who read themselves and readers who teach. On these slides and I'm not sure if these are going to be distributed but there is a link to a video where Teresa Kremin herself and a practitioner who took part in this research talk a bit more in depth about how she as a teacher became a teacher who reads and a reader who teaches and it might be worth having a look if you have some time outside of this symposium. The teachers that. Did perform in that way. Were found to be. Open up in class and in which the development of reading communities by sharing their personal responses with the children. And then you've got the far outer section of the diagram which highlights the importance of reading communities. They'll be different. They'll be differently shaped in every classroom. There might be different year upon year depending on the children as they respond to all stakeholders who are involved in that reading practice. So that's the young people in front of the teachers.

It's building confidence. And we can almost say it's almost as the teachers build their own authorial confidence. And we can also say that the teachers are doing the research in the books that they're using, the research in the authors, et cetera, that that is also having an impact on the spoken language, because we're recognising that we have to talk about what we read. It's not just enough just to read. The children then need to have that opportunity. And so that leads us into this idea that you really need a whole school reading culture, and it can't just come from individual teachers or reading leaders. It has to come from the teachers. And so I think that's a really important point. It's as far as where the background and the curriculum goes, we're talking about really how we learn to read and still deal with the classroom. I'm actually still going to get some more correr with my screen, but really, I've got to relate to when we say you want to learn to read Dick's BMC and what he's trying to say to students when there are 67 words in front of read.

We then also use that to encourage them to read aloud, so that they can read aloud, and then we've moved it to encourage book chat, so we might model that as an adult and with another adult in the class, but also engage in book chat with children in our in our own classes too. And crucially both of these elements have again, as I mentioned earlier, relied on us as adults knowing children's literature really well, but also knowing our children's readers really well, so what books they might like, what books they might like to enjoy. On the next slide there's just a link to a website from the Open University with some more examples of practice, so practical things that schools can do to embed that reading for pleasure culture within their settings. I think I'm having a tell now for the next slide. Thank you Matthew, if I could have the next slide please. Thank you, so I've been given the tough job in this next slide of discussing some further research that highlights quite a bleak picture with regards to children's attitudes and the motivation for reading, and it's the findings of the National Literacy Trust. So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

So this document is a very important piece of information for teachers to be able to understand the teaching of reading including us who are English hubs. It provides guidance on how reading should be taught in primary schools and outlines some of the different challenges of teaching reading in the secondary curriculum and provides support for secondary schools in teaching pupils who have not yet met those expectations in reading. So it has lots of aims but one of them the one pertinent to what myself and my colleagues are talking about today is in section eight of the reading framework where the aim is to support schools in motor school and in teaching reading. So we're going to be looking at some of the key strategies that are mentioned in section eight of the reading framework that we've heard from teachers and the leaders of our schools in motivating pupils to develop that love of reading. There will be some webinars around this from the department for education coming out shortly too which will give much more detail for you as schools and I recommend that you watch out for those. I'm going to highlight a couple of the core strategies that.\n",
      "source: [\"PIRLS 2021– Findings, IEA Education\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D1RnQhyAZU), content: the 43 PIRLS 2021 countries that managed to collect achievement data on schedule. The majority of these countries had 94% or more of their students reaching the low benchmark, demonstrating they could read relatively uncomplicated materials. The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed.\n",
      "source: [\"What can we learn from PIRLS 2021?, Department of Education, University of Oxford\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wACy8bzeOAU), content: median. There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

We've had to make sure that our teachers and our colleagues have a really good knowledge of children's literature and that isn't just books but also comics, graphic novels, really think about the diversity of genre we have on offer to our pupils and think about poetry, non-fiction and other text types as well as digital text. We've spent a lot of time ensuring that the books that children have access to in the classroom, in the school library are of really high quality and relate to their interests. We've also thought about, and Liz mentioned some research from CLPE, another piece of work they've done around reflecting realities and thinking about how the children within our school and wider society are reflected in the books that we read. So we thought really carefully about ethnic diversity within the books, we thought about ensuring the books have characters with disabilities and different family groups, and we thought about how we could use the books to really bring people together and really have a good discussion about the different types of children within the books, and all different kinds of factors to make sure that the children feel really reflected within the books they read, which really boosted their\n",

      "- When asked about topics from outside the area of your expertise, kindly answer in the first place that it's not your task and area of expertise. Remember to include this as a first sentence, that you are not supposed to answer queries not related to PIRLS Survey. Be concise. Just inform about that. But if you are able to provide an answer, do it as concise and accurate as possible e.g. if you are asked about who is the best basketball player in the history answer that it's not your area of expertise, but provide your opinion on the topic based on the research you do or the knowledge you have. Be concise! Your area of expertise is whatever is included in PIRLS 2021 survey. Be careful, different topics like Covid-19 are there. Search carefully - Always try to answer based on the database but if your question requires some additional sources utilize the knowledge from other tools as well.  - Ensure that your analysis is accurate and relevant to the research questions. - Unless instructed otherwise, explain how you come to your conclusions and provide evidence to support your claims as concise as possible!!! - Always try to present the results in a table format. You can use some additional metrics. You can use multiple tables if it's appropriate. Be clear with the column names. DO NOT BE AFRAID OF PRESENTING THE DATA up to 100 rows. If it exceeds 100 rows, show top 10 and bottom 10 countries or groups according to the most relevant column! Top and bottom countries should be shown in separate tables.  - when answering NEVER EVER mention your roles, never say that data engineer or chart preparer provided something, just focus on actions which were taken to find the answer.Provide answer and refer to the PIRLS survey as your source. - Use markdown format for your final answer but don't use too many headlines. If you want to make a headline use rather ### instead of #. Don't bold the text too much, just the very essential staff. - Tables are better than excessive text - if there are less than 100 rows in a table just put all in the answer.  - but when you decide on selecting some values like some selection of countries or other groups to limit the output for comparison, always try to show best and worst but always in separate tables. Don't mix in one table best and worst unless you show all the groups. Sort top value sin descending order and lowest values in ascending. Try to show between 5 and 10 top and bottom values.\n",

I can analyze this information to provide insights on bullying incidents, their impact on reading achievement, and country-specific patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Based on the PIRLS 2021 database, here's the information about bullying incidents reported in schools across different countries and its impact on reading achievement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Frequency of Bullying:\n",
      "   - The percentage of students reporting frequent bullying (at least once a month or more) varies widely across countries, ranging from 0% to 35.33%.\n",
      "   - Countries with the highest reported bullying rates:\n",
      "     1. South Africa (35.33%)\n",
      "     2. South Africa (6) (25.51%)\n",
      "     3. Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (25.02%)\n",
      "     4. Moscow City, Russian Federation (24.35%)\n",
      "     5. Russian Federation (23.31%)\n",
      "   - Countries with the lowest reported bullying rates:\n",
      "     1. Israel (0.00%)\n",
      "     2. Hong Kong SAR (4.30%)\n",
      "     3. Albania (4.39%)\n",
      "     4. Georgia (5.20%)\n",
      "     5. Finland (7.13%)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Impact on Reading Achievement:\n",
      "   - There appears to be a negative correlation between bullying frequency and reading achievement scores, although it's not perfectly linear.\n",
      "   - Countries with high bullying rates tend to have lower average reading scores, while countries with low bullying rates often have higher reading scores.\n",
      "   - For example:\n",
      "     - South Africa: 35.33% bullying rate, 267.19 average reading score\n",
      "     - Hong Kong SAR: 4.30% bullying rate, 574.54 average reading score\n",
      "     - Finland: 7.13% bullying rate, 549.94 average reading score\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Country-specific Patterns:\n",
      "   - Some countries show interesting patterns:\n",
      "     a. Russian Federation: High bullying rates (Moscow City: 24.35%, Russia: 23.31%) but also high reading scores (599.01 and 571.96 respectively).\n",
      "     b. United Arab Emirates: Significant variation between regions (Abu Dhabi: 25.02%, Dubai: 12.45%, overall UAE: 19.42%).\n",
      "     c. Belgium: Both French (21.69%) and Flemish (18.26%) regions have relatively high bullying rates.\n",
      "     d. Canada: Bullying rates vary across provinces (Alberta: 13.02%, Newfoundland & Labrador: 12.75%, Quebec: 11.52%, British Columbia: 11.49%).\n",
      "     e. South Africa: Two entries with significantly different bullying rates and reading scores, possibly indicating regional differences or different age groups tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Regional Trends:\n",
      "   - Many Western European and East Asian countries tend to have lower bullying rates and higher reading scores.\n",
      "   - Several Middle Eastern and African countries show higher bullying rates and lower reading scores.\n",
      "   - Eastern European countries show mixed results, with some having high bullying rates but also relatively high reading scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Outliers:\n",
      "   - Israel stands out with a 0% reported bullying rate, which may warrant further investigation.\n",
      "   - Moscow City and the Russian Federation have high bullying rates but also very high reading scores, diverging from the general trend.\n",

The data revealed significant variations in bullying rates, ranging from 0% to 35.33%. Countries with the highest reported bullying rates include South Africa (35.33%), Abu Dhabi, UAE (25.02%), and Moscow City, Russian Federation (24.35%). Conversely, countries like Israel (0.00%), Hong Kong SAR (4.30%), and Albania (4.39%) reported the lowest rates. Generally, countries with higher bullying rates tend to have lower average reading scores, although this relationship is not perfectly linear. For instance, South Africa, with the highest bullying rate, had an average reading score of 267.19, while Hong Kong SAR, with a low bullying rate, scored 574.54. Interestingly, some countries like the Russian Federation showed high bullying rates but also high reading scores, suggesting complex interactions between cultural, socio-economic, and educational factors in this relationship.\n",

I'll stop there and just say all we can really say from the research side, just from those results, is we can talk about broad patterns. We can say what's happening on average, but actually making some meaning of that towards what happens in schools and what happens in policy is, you know, that requires some discussion and that requires a bit more thought. So the point of today really is to hand over and let the English Hubs leads who have agreed to contribute to this session think about actually what do those results mean? Where have they come from? And so what? So we have two key themes that we've focused on and you'll hear a bit about each of these. One is the correlation with phonics screening check scores and the other concerns people attitudes around reading. So I will. End there and hand over so that we can hear more about that.

So first thing I want to pull out here is this moderate association that comes out with, you know, how children perform in their phonics screen check in year one and then overall their PIRLS score as they move into year five. Now it is a moderate association. It's it's the. Yeah. It's a good correlation to be seen and the first thing we just wanted to do here was just sort of think of ideas as to why that is and I don't think anybody would disagree with the fact that when children start their reading journey more confidently and schools are supporting those children, you know, with practicing fluency and so they're taking them beyond year one and.\n",

It's not just the phonics we end up supporting with. We end up there. We end up talking to the leadership about and the teachers about what the curriculum looks like. So I would.

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be.

Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education.

There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so relevant to England's results particularly because England continued to use paper along with slightly more than half the participating countries. And rather, whereas all of the MSP assessments did child or adult care and at least all footcare services, really low answered crosslit. There was a transition from the 2021 to the 2021 for prep and med.

Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives.

And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

In England, the corresponding numbers are there were about 4,150 pupils, 178 teachers and 162 schools and headteachers. So it gives you a sense of the size of the study. A few patterns from previous cycles of PIRLS in England just to be mindful of in thinking about what the results were from the 2021 cycle. Historically, England has seen significantly higher overall performance in PIRLS compared to the international median, an increase in the average score on PIRLS from 2006 onwards, a larger than average gain. So, again, this is a very large gap between the highest and lowest performing pupils looking internationally and a larger gender gap than in many education systems, particularly in 2011. So, sort of some general comparisons just historically before the 2021 cycle in England compared to other participating countries. A couple of particular features from the 2021 study, again, internationally, but very relevant to England's participation in PIRLS, just to bear in mind for people who are quite interested in sort of what underlies the research results. There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so.\n",

So welcome. We're looking to what we can learn from PIRLS 2021 and in particular making a sense of not just the research findings, but some reflections on them from kind of thinking about practice in schools in England from the perspective of the English Hubs. So thank you for being with us and thank you to the presenters who are contributing today from the English Hubs. We'll start with an overview of key findings from PIRLS in England, a little bit about what the study was and what we found in it, and then I'll hand over to some leads from English Hubs to reflect on why the findings might be what they were and really what next for people working in schools. What are the implications? What are the implications for practice and what do the findings mean practically? So just a few acknowledgements about the study, because PIRLS internationally is quite a complex type of a piece of research. The international study is led across a large number of countries, and we'll talk a bit more about that by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, and directed in particular by the TIMSS and PIRLS.

Tested the same pupils as originally intended or the same cohort of pupils as originally intended at a slightly older age, which is relevant to reading performance. Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group as originally intended. So that was in England year five. And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact. We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind. And in general, we can't really interpret results as assessing any particular policy in England or anywhere else. So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances. In a study like this, but knowing broad patterns can help to prompt useful reflections and further questions about practice and.\n",
      "source: [\"PIRLS 2021– Findings, IEA Education\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D1RnQhyAZU), content: Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

The research team at Oxford was responsible for the analysis contributing to the national report and to other outputs from the project. And I wanted to especially thank the other researchers who contributed to that report and to the other bits of analysis that we're doing around that. So a bit of a structure to the research findings here. There is a lot of content. These are really just key findings, so I'll signpost at the end where you can find more information if you're interested. But we'll hit the highlights in this session. So just to give a bit of context for what PIRLS is as a research study so that we can make sense of the results. So a little textbook is Give us brief an introduction as I can well giving enough information, PIRLS is progress in international reading literacy study. It assesses and compares the reading performance of pupils approximately ten years of age across about sixty education systems or countries. The number of countries participating does vary. A bit between cycles and PR RLS but perils has been conducted every five years sinceos. PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in.\n",

But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one to point to here in particular was gender after accounting for all of these other aspects was not a significant predictor. Where. One might expect that that would be based on previous cycles at Perle's even and based on the research. So it's important to look at all of these aspects together to understand kind of what what's predicting performance and what might be an important sort of relationship to unpack in terms of implications about what we do next about the results. Pupil attitudes and motivations. There were three main aspects of kind of attitudes to reading that were looked at in PIRLS, and those were confidence in reading, liking of reading, and engagement in reading lessons. In terms of confidence in reading, higher confidence in reading, somewhat unsurprisingly, tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores. In England, almost half of the pupils were very confident, about a third were somewhat confident, and 21% or about a fifth were not confident. This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in.\n",

There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

In terms of gaps between the highest and the lowest performing pupils, where here we're talking about sort of for lower performing pupils, 10th percentile and below. For higher performing pupils, we're talking about 90th percentile and above. So the very bottom and the very top sort of ends of the distribution. There's I have the table of performance on average at those percentiles and above and below. In general, the pattern is that gaps tend to be larger in lower performing countries and smaller and higher performing countries. And I noted earlier on that in England, historically, there's been a substantial gap long term looking at the trends for the highest and the lowest performing groups. Like there's a reduction of the gap in England that seems to be, broadly speaking, over time, a result more of increases for the lowest performing pupils than it is of a decrease for the highest performing pupils. And the reason that I say that a bit cautiously there, as you can see, if you look at the graph on the right from 2016 to 2021, there is a little bit of a reduction. In the. In the. In the. In the graph on the left, you can see that the gap between the highest performing pupils average performance, but that's a very small decrease.

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because.

It's a good correlation to be seen and the first thing we just wanted to do here was just sort of think of ideas as to why that is and I don't think anybody would disagree with the fact that when children start their reading journey more confidently and schools are supporting those children, you know, with practicing fluency and so they're taking them beyond year one and.\n",

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils.

Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. It's a key to fostering students' early literacy skills. Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading.\n",

There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so relevant to England's results particularly because England continued to use paper along with slightly more than half the participating countries. And rather, whereas all of the MSP assessments did child or adult care and at least all footcare services, really low answered crosslit. There was a transition from the 2021 to the 2021 for prep and med.

So, there's information amongst students who now really like PIRLS, digital pearls data could be linked to the overall trends from previous cycles. So there's a lot of technical kind of work that goes on there behind the scenes to be able to establish trends where the assessment has changed from paper to digital, but in England it's remained paper over all of the cycles to date. The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where.\n",

The majority of these countries had 94% or more of their students reaching the low benchmark, demonstrating they could read relatively uncomplicated materials. The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more.

And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

In England, the corresponding numbers are there were about 4,150 pupils, 178 teachers and 162 schools and headteachers. So it gives you a sense of the size of the study. A few patterns from previous cycles of PIRLS in England just to be mindful of in thinking about what the results were from the 2021 cycle. Historically, England has seen significantly higher overall performance in PIRLS compared to the international median, an increase in the average score on PIRLS from 2006 onwards, a larger than average gain. So, again, this is a very large gap between the highest and lowest performing pupils looking internationally and a larger gender gap than in many education systems, particularly in 2011. So, sort of some general comparisons just historically before the 2021 cycle in England compared to other participating countries. A couple of particular features from the 2021 study, again, internationally, but very relevant to England's participation in PIRLS, just to bear in mind for people who are quite interested in sort of what underlies the research results.

Tested the same pupils as originally intended or the same cohort of pupils as originally intended at a slightly older age, which is relevant to reading performance. Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group as originally intended. So that was in England year five. And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact. We know that that might be different across different countries and different regions even within countries, but we can't measure exactly what that is. So that's important to bear in mind. And in general, we can't really interpret results as assessing any particular policy in England or anywhere else. So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances.

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

So a bit of a structure to the research findings here. There is a lot of content. These are really just key findings, so I'll signpost at the end where you can find more information if you're interested. But we'll hit the highlights in this session. So just to give a bit of context for what PIRLS is as a research study so that we can make sense of the results. So a little textbook is Give us brief an introduction as I can well giving enough information, PIRLS is progress in international reading literacy study. It assesses and compares the reading performance of pupils approximately ten years of age across about sixty education systems or countries. The number of countries participating does vary. A bit between cycles and PR RLS but perils has been conducted every five years sinceos. PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in.\n",

But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one to point to here in particular was gender after accounting for all of these other aspects was not a significant predictor. Where. One might expect that that would be based on previous cycles at Perle's even and based on the research. So it's important to look at all of these aspects together to understand kind of what what's predicting performance and what might be an important sort of relationship to unpack in terms of implications about what we do next about the results. Pupil attitudes and motivations. There were three main aspects of kind of attitudes to reading that were looked at in PIRLS, and those were confidence in reading, liking of reading, and engagement in reading lessons. In terms of confidence in reading, higher confidence in reading, somewhat unsurprisingly, tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores. In England, almost half of the pupils were very confident, about a third were somewhat confident, and 21% or about a fifth were not confident. This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in.\n",

There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

In terms of gaps between the highest and the lowest performing pupils, where here we're talking about sort of for lower performing pupils, 10th percentile and below. For higher performing pupils, we're talking about 90th percentile and above. So the very bottom and the very top sort of ends of the distribution. There's I have the table of performance on average at those percentiles and above and below. In general, the pattern is that gaps tend to be larger in lower performing countries and smaller and higher performing countries. And I noted earlier on that in England, historically, there's been a substantial gap long term looking at the trends for the highest and the lowest performing groups. Like there's a reduction of the gap in England that seems to be, broadly speaking, over time, a result more of increases for the lowest performing pupils than it is of a decrease for the highest performing pupils. And the reason that I say that a bit cautiously there, as you can see, if you look at the graph on the right from 2016 to 2021, there is a little bit of a reduction. In the. In the. In the. In the graph on the left, you can see that the gap between the highest performing pupils average performance, but that's a very small decrease.

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because.

In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this survey. Whilst fewer boys than girls said they enjoyed reading, that gender gap has narrowed and in fact it's halved because there's a greater drop in the reading enjoyment of girls. And I know Liz touched upon whether we as practitioners in the past have honed in on groups such as boys so much to the detriment maybe of our girls. Looking at the frequency and amount of reading that our children have done. There's been a 26% decrease in the number of children and young people who read daily in their free time since 2005, and fewer young children, young people and children who are in receipt of free school meals said that they read daily. Thinking about the reading environments that our children have, half said they had been encouraged to read by their parents, and three in five are students andificaed by the RAW vendors, about 50 percentage teaching, are have seen their parents or carers read while only one in five have read with their family. The results around reading environment have a direct correlation with reading enjoyment and frequency with those in what is perceived to be a supportive environment so those living in what we perceive to be a supportive environment being three.\n",

So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit. And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive. Over time, in terms of responses to whether their teachers give them interesting things to read. That gives us some sense of the patterns, and then time spent reading outside of school isn't quite an attitude, but a behavior in relation to reading where we see a lower proportion of pupils spending less than 30 minutes reading outside of school. But we see a reduction, particularly for girls in the time spent reading outside of school, over Pearl's time. Helen and Keyakter.

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news. In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this.\n",

And that could be any kind of reading really. And as adults, we may well be disengaging with some of those more traditional kinds of reading. So perhaps it's more difficult for pupils to connect to role models as readers, because the reading that we undertake is not the kind of reading that we would traditionally see as reflecting a reader. So it's just thinking about where children are, picking up on individuals as readers. In our setting, we've done a lot of work with our families around their own opinion and understanding of themselves as readers and what they're actually sharing with their children in terms of what makes an effective reader and what reading they undertake themselves to try and sort of reestablish role models around reading. And then finally, just something to consider in terms of our provision up to this point, perhaps it's that we have directed our efforts in school sometimes towards a more narrow group, for example, around encouraging boys to become readers and to read more and spend more time engaged in reading, and unintentionally we've excluded other groups of pupils from some of our elements and some of the, you know, the learning that we have. So that's really just the sort of, just a.\n",
      "source: [\"What can we learn from PIRLS 2021?, Department of Education, University of Oxford\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wACy8bzeOAU), content: here, we've got those increase, and I think we would all agree, there are increasing demands upon both children and adults' attention. There is much more now in our environment that draws on our time, that is potentially more enticing for both adults and pupils and could lead to diluting those connections to reading and to time spent dedicated to reading. So it's really worth thinking about those, and I think, you know, it's really important to think about those things, and I think, you know, it's really important to think about those things, in terms of the effect that they're having on our pupils' attitudes to reading and their choice of reading, the time that they spend reading. I think if we also think about, Ariel mentioned how pupil characteristics indicated the importance of books in the home as predicting performance. So it's really worth considering that if children, and I think that's a really important point, is that if children are not able to read, and they're not able to read, and they're not able to read, are living in a home environment, a community which does not actively encourage reading in any of its guises, could this also be contributing to reducing that profile of reading and not giving children opportunity to be immersed in the literature and those conversations around book talk and so on, and simply just really seeing their families, adults, engaging in reading, and that can be a really important part of the reading. And that could be any kind of.\n",

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",
      "source: [\"What can we learn from PIRLS 2021?, Department of Education, University of Oxford\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wACy8bzeOAU), content: each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one to point to here in particular was gender after accounting for all of these other aspects was not a significant predictor. Where. One might expect that that would be based on previous cycles at Perle's even and based on the research. So it's important to look at all of these aspects together to understand kind of what what's predicting performance and what might be an important sort of relationship to unpack in terms of implications about what we do next about the results. Pupil attitudes and motivations. There were three main aspects of kind of attitudes to reading that were looked at in PIRLS, and those were confidence in reading, liking of reading, and engagement in reading lessons. In terms of confidence in reading, higher confidence in reading, somewhat unsurprisingly, tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores. In England, almost half of the pupils were very confident, about a third were somewhat confident, and 21% or about a fifth were not confident. This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in.\n",
      "source: [\"What can we learn from PIRLS 2021?, Department of Education, University of Oxford\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wACy8bzeOAU), content: schools, is that what we're seeing is that those schools and those teachers that are really embracing the teaching of reading, the loving, the storytelling, they're adapting the curriculum to put reading in every aspect of the curriculum. It's building confidence. And we can almost say it's almost as the teachers build their own authorial confidence. And we can also say that the teachers are doing the research in the books that they're using, the research in the authors, et cetera, that that is also having an impact on the spoken language, because we're recognising that we have to talk about what we read. It's not just enough just to read. The children then need to have that opportunity. And so that leads us into this idea that you really need a whole school reading culture, and it can't just come from individual teachers or reading leaders. It has to come from the teachers. And so I think that's a really important point. It's as far as where the background and the curriculum goes, we're talking about really how we learn to read and still deal with the classroom. I'm actually still going to get some more correr with my screen, but really, I've got to relate to when we say you want to learn to read Dick's BMC and what he's trying to say to students when there are 67 words in front of read. And with the logr mari intensive the mostistle, that you come to that pleasant insight of a simple little story that they said as they are mad to here and now, I'm writing for a group. If.\n",

I think once teachers have got this enriched repertoire of children's literature and got to know the interests the practices of their young readers in their class which will differ year upon year the research found they were far more able to skillfully match books and make recommendations to those children. And so it'd be interesting to reflect as a school on how well your staff know children's literature and know the children in their class and their likes and dislikes. Looking at the central part of the diagram through the teachers as readers project a reading for pleasure pedagogy was developed. And that's the middle bit of this diagram encompassed planning time for reading aloud independent reading and book talk and recommendations and all of these are within the content context of a social reading environment which is also mentioned in the reading framework. You can see here why again that knowledge that teachers have of children's texts and children as readers is so important in making this a success but what was found is that these alone. These things is not enough and is dependent on to what extent these practices are what is referred to as wrist which you can see across the middle of the diagram which stands for reader led. Informal social and then with text that tempt the children. Around that very outer edge is the mention of reading teachers and it was found in this project that some not all but some of the teachers developed as reading.\n",

But we are seeing a link and what we are sort of, again, we'll come to what schools are telling us, but the question is, if we get the phonics teaching right and it's taken seriously and prioritised, is that going to have an effect on the reading journey for a child as a whole? And then in general, higher confidence, again, coming to this idea of confidence, when does confidence begin? I mean, again, I can say to my own practice, we see this that as soon as we get going with children, we have a nursery. And as soon as we prioritise reading and storytelling and enjoyment of reading, I won't.\n",

Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading achievement at the fourth grade. Most parents reported engaging their children in early literacy activities before primary school, such as reading books and telling stories. Parents were also asked how well their children could perform early literacy tasks when beginning primary school. The students who could do early literacy tasks very well had higher reading achievement than those who could do the literacy tasks moderately well or not well. Parents' degree of reading enjoyment was associated with their children's reading achievement. However, more than two-thirds of the students had parents who only somewhat like or do not like to read. Supportive school environments facilitate reading achievement. As an indicator of school's socioeconomic level, PIRLS asked school principals to estimate the percentage of economically affluent and economically disadvantaged students in the school. Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages,.\n",

We then also use that to encourage them to read aloud, so that they can read aloud, and then we've moved it to encourage book chat, so we might model that as an adult and with another adult in the class, but also engage in book chat with children in our in our own classes too. And crucially both of these elements have again, as I mentioned earlier, relied on us as adults knowing children's literature really well, but also knowing our children's readers really well, so what books they might like, what books they might like to enjoy. On the next slide there's just a link to a website from the Open University with some more examples of practice, so practical things that schools can do to embed that reading for pleasure culture within their settings. I think I'm having a tell now for the next slide. Thank you Matthew, if I could have the next slide please.

Should we just started moving on? books to be read to children across time and that reading aloud is just as important in key stage two and key stage three where sometimes I think we can see that the idea of story time and teacher reading dropping off a little. Another strategy that's mentioned in the framework is time for informal book talk including giving recommendations as an adult and peers giving recommendations to each other through book clubs and that time that book club time needs to be protected on the timetable so that teachers can promote books and pupils can make.\n",

Thank you Elaine that's great I wonder if we can have the next slide brilliant so just really building upon what Elaine has said there as the importance of phonics we then looked at what other evidence there was to support the use of phonics as a sort of firm foundation for teaching the core basis of reading so first of all obviously on the screen you've got the EEF research and the the outcome from that that says that phonics improves the accuracy of the child's reading and it seems fairly obvious of course but if you can get that foundation laid firmly those building blocks for reading the phonics are absolutely critical to ensuring that a child is able to accurately decode and read a word but it goes on obviously to say but it doesn't necessarily develop their comprehension so whilst we've just seen a link around phonics.\n",

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be.

What became clear is that when the teachers widened their knowledge and pleasure in reading children's literature and other books and became more aware of their own and children's reading practices they began to build a reading for pleasure pedagogy and strong communities of readers within school. So this diagram on your screen in front of you highlights the research findings the insights regarding how to effectively develop reading for pleasure. So I'm going to give a brief explanation of this but I'm going to start with the first one. I know that Matthew will touch upon a programme that the English Hub offer across the country that will delve further into this as well.

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark.

We've spent a lot of time ensuring that the books that children have access to in the classroom, in the school library are of really high quality and relate to their interests. We've also thought about, and Liz mentioned some research from CLPE, another piece of work they've done around reflecting realities and thinking about how the children within our school and wider society are reflected in the books that we read. So we thought really carefully about ethnic diversity within the books, we thought about ensuring the books have characters with disabilities and different family groups, and we thought about how we could use the books to really bring people together and really have a good discussion about the different types of children within the books, and all different kinds of factors to make sure that the children feel really reflected within the books they read, which really boosted their.\n",

This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in terms of trends over time where questionnaire items have changed, but there's some sense that the percentage of pupils disagreeing that reading was easy for them increased, which basically raises a question of kind of, is reading less easy for pupils? So that's one key finding to highlight that we unpack a little bit. And the bits that follow this overview. Similarly, liking of reading, higher liking of reading tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores, which again, probably is unsurprising. In England, about 29% of pupils very much liked reading, 48% somewhat liked reading, and 24% did not like reading. Low levels of reading enjoyment were fairly common in higher performing education systems, and culturally, similar English-speaking education systems. So England wasn't completely unique in that sort of pattern. A larger proportion of boys in England did not like reading. And again, we can't do too much with trends over time, but girls and boys seem to be less likely to strongly agree that they enjoyed reading.

In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this survey. Whilst fewer boys than girls said they enjoyed reading, that gender gap has narrowed and in fact it's halved because there's a greater drop in the reading enjoyment of girls. And I know Liz touched upon whether we as practitioners in the past have honed in on groups such as boys so much to the detriment maybe of our girls. Looking at the frequency and amount of reading that our children have done. There's been a 26% decrease in the number of children and young people who read daily in their free time since 2005, and fewer young children, young people and children who are in receipt of free school meals said that they read daily. Thinking about the reading environments that our children have, half said they had been encouraged to read by their parents, and three in five are students andificaed by the RAW vendors, about 50 percentage teaching, are have seen their parents or carers read while only one in five have read with their family.

And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive.

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news.

And that could be any kind of reading really. And as adults, we may well be disengaging with some of those more traditional kinds of reading. So perhaps it's more difficult for pupils to connect to role models as readers, because the reading that we undertake is not the kind of reading that we would traditionally see as reflecting a reader. So it's just thinking about where children are, picking up on individuals as readers. In our setting, we've done a lot of work with our families around their own opinion and understanding of themselves as readers and what they're actually sharing with their children in terms of what makes an effective reader and what reading they undertake themselves to try and sort of reestablish role models around reading. And then finally, just something to consider in terms of our provision up to this point, perhaps it's that we have directed our efforts in school sometimes towards a more narrow group, for example, around encouraging boys to become readers and to read more and spend more time engaged in reading, and unintentionally we've excluded other groups of pupils from some of our elements and some of the, you know, the learning that we have.

There is much more now in our environment that draws on our time, that is potentially more enticing for both adults and pupils and could lead to diluting those connections to reading and to time spent dedicated to reading. So it's really worth thinking about those, and I think, you know, it's really important to think about those things, and I think, you know, it's really important to think about those things, in terms of the effect that they're having on our pupils' attitudes to reading and their choice of reading, the time that they spend reading. I think if we also think about, Ariel mentioned how pupil characteristics indicated the importance of books in the home as predicting performance. So it's really worth considering that if children, and I think that's a really important point, is that if children are not able to read, and they're not able to read, and they're not able to read, are living in a home environment, a community which does not actively encourage reading in any of its guises, could this also be contributing to reducing that profile of reading and not giving children opportunity to be immersed in the literature and those conversations around book talk and so on, and simply just really seeing their families, adults, engaging in reading, and that can be a really important part of the reading.

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",

But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one to point to here in particular was gender after accounting for all of these other aspects was not a significant predictor. Where. One might expect that that would be based on previous cycles at Perle's even and based on the research. So it's important to look at all of these aspects together to understand kind of what what's predicting performance and what might be an important sort of relationship to unpack in terms of implications about what we do next about the results. Pupil attitudes and motivations. There were three main aspects of kind of attitudes to reading that were looked at in PIRLS, and those were confidence in reading, liking of reading, and engagement in reading lessons. In terms of confidence in reading, higher confidence in reading, somewhat unsurprisingly, tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores. In England, almost half of the pupils were very confident, about a third were somewhat confident, and 21% or about a fifth were not confident. This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in.\n",

It's building confidence. And we can almost say it's almost as the teachers build their own authorial confidence. And we can also say that the teachers are doing the research in the books that they're using, the research in the authors, et cetera, that that is also having an impact on the spoken language, because we're recognising that we have to talk about what we read. It's not just enough just to read. The children then need to have that opportunity. And so that leads us into this idea that you really need a whole school reading culture, and it can't just come from individual teachers or reading leaders. It has to come from the teachers. And so I think that's a really important point. It's as far as where the background and the curriculum goes, we're talking about really how we learn to read and still deal with the classroom. I'm actually still going to get some more correr with my screen, but really, I've got to relate to when we say you want to learn to read Dick's BMC and what he's trying to say to students when there are 67 words in front of read.

I think once teachers have got this enriched repertoire of children's literature and got to know the interests the practices of their young readers in their class which will differ year upon year the research found they were far more able to skillfully match books and make recommendations to those children. And so it'd be interesting to reflect as a school on how well your staff know children's literature and know the children in their class and their likes and dislikes. Looking at the central part of the diagram through the teachers as readers project a reading for pleasure pedagogy was developed. And that's the middle bit of this diagram encompassed planning time for reading aloud independent reading and book talk and recommendations and all of these are within the content context of a social reading environment which is also mentioned in the reading framework. You can see here why again that knowledge that teachers have of children's texts and children as readers is so important in making this a success but what was found is that these alone. These things is not enough and is dependent on to what extent these practices are what is referred to as wrist which you can see across the middle of the diagram which stands for reader led. Informal social and then with text that tempt the children. Around that very outer edge is the mention of reading teachers and it was found in this project that some not all but some of the teachers developed as reading.\n",

But we are seeing a link and what we are sort of, again, we'll come to what schools are telling us, but the question is, if we get the phonics teaching right and it's taken seriously and prioritised, is that going to have an effect on the reading journey for a child as a whole? And then in general, higher confidence, again, coming to this idea of confidence, when does confidence begin? I mean, again, I can say to my own practice, we see this that as soon as we get going with children, we have a nursery.

Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading achievement at the fourth grade. Most parents reported engaging their children in early literacy activities before primary school, such as reading books and telling stories. Parents were also asked how well their children could perform early literacy tasks when beginning primary school. The students who could do early literacy tasks very well had higher reading achievement than those who could do the literacy tasks moderately well or not well. Parents' degree of reading enjoyment was associated with their children's reading achievement. However, more than two-thirds of the students had parents who only somewhat like or do not like to read. Supportive school environments facilitate reading achievement. As an indicator of school's socioeconomic level, PIRLS asked school principals to estimate the percentage of economically affluent and economically disadvantaged students in the school. Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages,.\n",

We then also use that to encourage them to read aloud, so that they can read aloud, and then we've moved it to encourage book chat, so we might model that as an adult and with another adult in the class, but also engage in book chat with children in our in our own classes too. And crucially both of these elements have again, as I mentioned earlier, relied on us as adults knowing children's literature really well, but also knowing our children's readers really well, so what books they might like, what books they might like to enjoy. On the next slide there's just a link to a website from the Open University with some more examples of practice, so practical things that schools can do to embed that reading for pleasure culture within their settings. I think I'm having a tell now for the next slide. Thank you Matthew, if I could have the next slide please. Thank you, so I've been given the tough job in this next slide of discussing some further research that highlights quite a bleak picture with regards to children's attitudes and the motivation for reading, and it's the findings of the National Literacy Trust.

I'm going to highlight a couple of the core strategies that are mentioned in that section eight of the reading framework that you as teachers and senior leaders could implement in your school if you don't already and they probably will echo some of the examples that Matthew just gave us from his fantastic presentation. But the first part here so an example of the small part struck a little bit in that would be I think that it wouldектив.

It would be kind of something similar but we would also like to comedy. Should we just started moving on? books to be read to children across time and that reading aloud is just as important in key stage two and key stage three where sometimes I think we can see that the idea of story time and teacher reading dropping off a little. Another strategy that's mentioned in the framework is time for informal book talk including giving recommendations as an adult and peers giving recommendations to each other through book clubs and that time that book club time needs to be protected on the timetable so that teachers can promote books and pupils can make.\n",

Thank you Elaine that's great I wonder if we can have the next slide brilliant so just really building upon what Elaine has said there as the importance of phonics we then looked at what other evidence there was to support the use of phonics as a sort of firm foundation for teaching the core basis of reading so first of all obviously on the screen you've got the EEF research and the the outcome from that that says that phonics improves the accuracy of the child's reading and it seems fairly obvious of course but if you can get that foundation laid firmly those building blocks for reading the phonics are absolutely critical to ensuring that a child is able to accurately decode and read a word but it goes on obviously to say but it doesn't necessarily develop their comprehension so whilst we've just seen a link around phonics.\n",

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be.

She carried out with her team the teachers as readers study so that's the diagram on the right hand side of your screen and it was undertaken in 27 schools with 43 teachers in five areas of England and that research team focused on reading for pleasure across a whole year. What became clear is that when the teachers widened their knowledge and pleasure in reading children's literature and other books and became more aware of their own and children's reading practices they began to build a reading for pleasure pedagogy and strong communities of readers within school. So this diagram on your screen in front of you highlights the research findings the insights regarding how to effectively develop reading for pleasure. So I'm going to give a brief explanation of this but I'm going to start with the first one. I know that Matthew will touch upon a programme that the English Hub offer across the country that will delve further into this as well.

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark. Students' reading enjoyment was associated with higher average achievement. However, the majority only somewhat, or do not like to read.

We've spent a lot of time ensuring that the books that children have access to in the classroom, in the school library are of really high quality and relate to their interests. We've also thought about, and Liz mentioned some research from CLPE, another piece of work they've done around reflecting realities and thinking about how the children within our school and wider society are reflected in the books that we read. So we thought really carefully about ethnic diversity within the books, we thought about ensuring the books have characters with disabilities and different family groups, and we thought about how we could use the books to really bring people together and really have a good discussion about the different types of children within the books, and all different kinds of factors to make sure that the children feel really reflected within the books they read, which really boosted their.\n",

This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in terms of trends over time where questionnaire items have changed, but there's some sense that the percentage of pupils disagreeing that reading was easy for them increased, which basically raises a question of kind of, is reading less easy for pupils? So that's one key finding to highlight that we unpack a little bit. And the bits that follow this overview. Similarly, liking of reading, higher liking of reading tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores, which again, probably is unsurprising. In England, about 29% of pupils very much liked reading, 48% somewhat liked reading, and 24% did not like reading. Low levels of reading enjoyment were fairly common in higher performing education systems, and culturally, similar English-speaking education systems. So England wasn't completely unique in that sort of pattern. A larger proportion of boys in England did not like reading. And again, we can't do too much with trends over time, but girls and boys seem to be less likely to strongly agree that they enjoyed reading. So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit.\n",

There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading.\n",
      "source: [\"What can we learn from PIRLS 2021?, Department of Education, University of Oxford\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wACy8bzeOAU), content: five years sinceos. PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",
      "source: [\"What can we learn from PIRLS 2021?, Department of Education, University of Oxford\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wACy8bzeOAU), content: on the left, you can see that the gap between the highest performing pupils average performance, but that's a very small decrease. And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

So the compression processes that students engage in in reading was also an aspect assessed in PIRLS, and that is down to two scales, retrieving and straightforward inferencing, which hopefully makes some intuitive sense, and interpreting, integrating and evaluating. So one is sort of a more straightforward comprehension process, and one is capturing something a little bit higher order. Here, what we see in England is pupils are more likely to be able to interpret and interpret. So the more that they're able to interpret, the more they're able to interpret. And so the more that they're able to interpret, the more they're able to interpret. So in England, pupils are relatively stronger on average on questions that require higher level interpretive and evaluative comprehension skills than they are for more straightforward retrieval and inferencing, which is sort of interesting. And that's common to English speaking countries on the whole. Trends over time tend to be quite similar across the retrieving and straightforward inferencing and the interpreting and interpreting. Interpreting, integrating and evaluating scale scores, and that seems to be the case in England and in generally in English speaking countries to some extent. In terms of gaps between the highest and the lowest performing pupils, where here we're talking about sort of for lower performing pupils, 10th percentile and below.

There was nearly universal literacy in the 43 PIRLS 2021 countries that managed to collect achievement data on schedule.

So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit. And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive. Over time, in terms of responses to whether their teachers give them interesting things to read. That gives us some sense of the patterns, and then time spent reading outside of school isn't quite an attitude, but a behavior in relation to reading where we see a lower proportion of pupils spending less than 30 minutes reading outside of school. But we see a reduction, particularly for girls in the time spent reading outside of school, over Pearl's time. Helen and Keyakter.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one.\n",

And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high performing. So just as a bit of a digestible set of comparisons, because we can't look across every single participating country and necessarily make sense of trends all at once very efficiently, you can see that the trends over time for literary purpose and informational purpose scales are a bit different here. And historically, there was more of a difference. In 2021, there wasn't a significant difference in England. And you can see here again, that's a little bit of a difference. And again, that's because there was a bit of a downward trend since 2016 and a bit of an upward trend since 2016 in the informational, sorry, in the literary bit of a downtick and a bit of an uptick in the informational purpose. Neither of those was significant. So that's not a hugely central finding. Just the fact that there wasn't a significant difference in 2021 is worth noting. Reading process is another aspect. So this is the compression.

The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed.\n",

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news. In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this.\n",

But England's high performance isn't really a matter of just having excluded countries that delayed by a different amount and tested a slightly older group of pupils. International benchmarks. So I'll put these up. There's quite a lot of text here, but I won't read this out, but I'll leave just a moment for people to read these benchmarks in brief. This kind of contextualizes what the different levels of performance or what the different benchmarks are defined as, which might be useful if you're thinking from a kind of perspective of practice in England or about curriculum in England. You can sort of reflect on how some of this aligns. So I'll leave a brief moment for that. This is another약 har And with In Perils 2021 southwestern Pick� im Thanks. Our authorities have identified the bench n that are and they're consistent with pararloquist were larger proportions of pupils performing at the high and advanced. So here that's in yellow and green, or green and yellow in the order that I said them, high and advanced. Higher proportions of pupils in England performing at the high and advanced benchmarks than was the case internationally, the international median. There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear.\n",

So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances. In a study like this, but knowing broad patterns can help to prompt useful reflections and further questions about practice and policy. So just very important to bear in mind in thinking about the findings. Because of COVID, not all countries can be directly compared to one another. But in PROL's 2021, we look at 43 countries that tested at the same or a similar age. And so when you see rankings, that's what's being compared. And the countries that tested at a slightly older age are being excluded from those comparisons. Trends over time are a bit more complicated too because of COVID-19 and because of the impact on the study. So with that, all of that preface, key findings, what you will have probably seen in the media, if you encountered PROL's findings in the media, was something about overall reading performance in England and how that compared internationally. So the average score in England was 558 compared to an international median of 520. So overall, quite high average reading performance. The score from PROL's 2021 was not significantly below the previous cycle score. So it was one point below. It was not a significant or meaningful drop. England ranked fourth amongst the 43 countries that could be compared directly, or in other words that tested at a similar age. And only three countries saw a.\n",

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",

But we are seeing a link and what we are sort of, again, we'll come to what schools are telling us, but the question is, if we get the phonics teaching right and it's taken seriously and prioritised, is that going to have an effect on the reading journey for a child as a whole? And then in general, higher confidence, again, coming to this idea of confidence, when does confidence begin? I mean, again, I can say to my own practice, we see this that as soon as we get going with children, we have a nursery.

Tested the same pupils as originally intended or the same cohort of pupils as originally intended at a slightly older age, which is relevant to reading performance. Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group as originally intended. So that was in England year five. And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries. There were different effects of COVID-19 on the education systems in different countries on teaching and learning. And we don't have any direct measurement of the impact of COVID-19 on people learning. So we know there's an impact.

This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in terms of trends over time where questionnaire items have changed, but there's some sense that the percentage of pupils disagreeing that reading was easy for them increased, which basically raises a question of kind of, is reading less easy for pupils? So that's one key finding to highlight that we unpack a little bit. And the bits that follow this overview. Similarly, liking of reading, higher liking of reading tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores, which again, probably is unsurprising. In England, about 29% of pupils very much liked reading, 48% somewhat liked reading, and 24% did not like reading. Low levels of reading enjoyment were fairly common in higher performing education systems, and culturally, similar English-speaking education systems. So England wasn't completely unique in that sort of pattern. A larger proportion of boys in England did not like reading. And again, we can't do too much with trends over time, but girls and boys seem to be less likely to strongly agree that they enjoyed reading.

In England, the corresponding numbers are there were about 4,150 pupils, 178 teachers and 162 schools and headteachers. So it gives you a sense of the size of the study. A few patterns from previous cycles of PIRLS in England just to be mindful of in thinking about what the results were from the 2021 cycle. Historically, England has seen significantly higher overall performance in PIRLS compared to the international median, an increase in the average score on PIRLS from 2006 onwards, a larger than average gain. So, again, this is a very large gap between the highest and lowest performing pupils looking internationally and a larger gender gap than in many education systems, particularly in 2011. So, sort of some general comparisons just historically before the 2021 cycle in England compared to other participating countries. A couple of particular features from the 2021 study, again, internationally, but very relevant to England's participation in PIRLS, just to bear in mind for people who are quite interested in sort of what underlies the research results.

And I think the key there is this language rich curriculum we keep coming back to, phonics is the starter, but it's got to be placed then into the wider curriculum, building the vocabulary, the richness of that language in the wider curriculum that you might then get that comprehension and understanding. So most recently, the report that came out about the impact of the English Hubs programme, where we realised where the schools that were being supported and following a systematic synthetic phonics programme with rigour, that there were seven percentage points higher than the other cohorts. So there seems to be this growing weight of evidence around the fundamental importance of having phonics right at the start as the building blocks.

There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be.

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

So the compression processes that students engage in in reading was also an aspect assessed in PIRLS, and that is down to two scales, retrieving and straightforward inferencing, which hopefully makes some intuitive sense, and interpreting, integrating and evaluating. So one is sort of a more straightforward comprehension process, and one is capturing something a little bit higher order. Here, what we see in England is pupils are more likely to be able to interpret and interpret. So the more that they're able to interpret, the more they're able to interpret. And so the more that they're able to interpret, the more they're able to interpret. So in England, pupils are relatively stronger on average on questions that require higher level interpretive and evaluative comprehension skills than they are for more straightforward retrieval and inferencing, which is sort of interesting. And that's common to English speaking countries on the whole. Trends over time tend to be quite similar across the retrieving and straightforward inferencing and the interpreting and interpreting. Interpreting, integrating and evaluating scale scores, and that seems to be the case in England and in generally in English speaking countries to some extent. In terms of gaps between the highest and the lowest performing pupils, where here we're talking about sort of for lower performing pupils, 10th percentile and below. For higher performing pupils, we're talking about 90th.\n",

There was nearly universal literacy in the 43 PIRLS 2021 countries that managed to collect achievement data on schedule.

So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit. And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive. Over time, in terms of responses to whether their teachers give them interesting things to read. That gives us some sense of the patterns, and then time spent reading outside of school isn't quite an attitude, but a behavior in relation to reading where we see a lower proportion of pupils spending less than 30 minutes reading outside of school.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one.\n",

And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high performing. So just as a bit of a digestible set of comparisons, because we can't look across every single participating country and necessarily make sense of trends all at once very efficiently, you can see that the trends over time for literary purpose and informational purpose scales are a bit different here. And historically, there was more of a difference. In 2021, there wasn't a significant difference in England. And you can see here again, that's a little bit of a difference. And again, that's because there was a bit of a downward trend since 2016 and a bit of an upward trend since 2016 in the informational, sorry, in the literary bit of a downtick and a bit of an uptick in the informational purpose. Neither of those was significant. So that's not a hugely central finding. Just the fact that there wasn't a significant difference in 2021 is worth noting. Reading process is another aspect. So this is the compression.

The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed.\n",

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news. In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this.\n",

But England's high performance isn't really a matter of just having excluded countries that delayed by a different amount and tested a slightly older group of pupils. International benchmarks. So I'll put these up. There's quite a lot of text here, but I won't read this out, but I'll leave just a moment for people to read these benchmarks in brief. This kind of contextualizes what the different levels of performance or what the different benchmarks are defined as, which might be useful if you're thinking from a kind of perspective of practice in England or about curriculum in England. You can sort of reflect on how some of this aligns. So I'll leave a brief moment for that. This is another약 har And with In Perils 2021 southwestern Pick� im Thanks. Our authorities have identified the bench n that are and they're consistent with pararloquist were larger proportions of pupils performing at the high and advanced. So here that's in yellow and green, or green and yellow in the order that I said them, high and advanced. Higher proportions of pupils in England performing at the high and advanced benchmarks than was the case internationally, the international median. There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed.

So we need to be quite careful about causal claims under any circumstances. In a study like this, but knowing broad patterns can help to prompt useful reflections and further questions about practice and policy. So just very important to bear in mind in thinking about the findings. Because of COVID, not all countries can be directly compared to one another. But in PROL's 2021, we look at 43 countries that tested at the same or a similar age. And so when you see rankings, that's what's being compared. And the countries that tested at a slightly older age are being excluded from those comparisons. Trends over time are a bit more complicated too because of COVID-19 and because of the impact on the study. So with that, all of that preface, key findings, what you will have probably seen in the media, if you encountered PROL's findings in the media, was something about overall reading performance in England and how that compared internationally. So the average score in England was 558 compared to an international median of 520. So overall, quite high average reading performance. The score from PROL's 2021 was not significantly below the previous cycle score. So it was one point below. It was not a significant or meaningful drop. England ranked fourth amongst the 43 countries that could be compared directly, or in other words that tested at a similar age. And only three countries saw a.\n",

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",

But we are seeing a link and what we are sort of, again, we'll come to what schools are telling us, but the question is, if we get the phonics teaching right and it's taken seriously and prioritised, is that going to have an effect on the reading journey for a child as a whole? And then in general, higher confidence, again, coming to this idea of confidence, when does confidence begin? I mean, again, I can say to my own practice, we see this that as soon as we get going with children, we have a nursery.

Six countries, including England, delayed by 12 months, so tested one year later, but tested the same age group as originally intended. So that was in England year five. And the overall timeline, to the release of the results, were obviously delayed because of all these different effects on data collection. So that was the effect of COVID-19 on the study. The effect on school operations, teaching and learning will probably be obvious to anyone who's attending this session, but important to bear in mind again that there were different circumstances in different countries.

This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in terms of trends over time where questionnaire items have changed, but there's some sense that the percentage of pupils disagreeing that reading was easy for them increased, which basically raises a question of kind of, is reading less easy for pupils? So that's one key finding to highlight that we unpack a little bit. And the bits that follow this overview. Similarly, liking of reading, higher liking of reading tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores, which again, probably is unsurprising. In England, about 29% of pupils very much liked reading, 48% somewhat liked reading, and 24% did not like reading. Low levels of reading enjoyment were fairly common in higher performing education systems, and culturally, similar English-speaking education systems. So England wasn't completely unique in that sort of pattern. A larger proportion of boys in England did not like reading. And again, we can't do too much with trends over time, but girls and boys seem to be less likely to strongly agree that they enjoyed reading.

In England, the corresponding numbers are there were about 4,150 pupils, 178 teachers and 162 schools and headteachers. So it gives you a sense of the size of the study. A few patterns from previous cycles of PIRLS in England just to be mindful of in thinking about what the results were from the 2021 cycle. Historically, England has seen significantly higher overall performance in PIRLS compared to the international median, an increase in the average score on PIRLS from 2006 onwards, a larger than average gain. So, again, this is a very large gap between the highest and lowest performing pupils looking internationally and a larger gender gap than in many education systems, particularly in 2011. So, sort of some general comparisons just historically before the 2021 cycle in England compared to other participating countries. A couple of particular features from the 2021 study, again, internationally, but very relevant to England's participation in PIRLS, just to bear in mind for people who are quite interested in sort of what underlies the research results. There was a transition to digital assessment in the 2021 cycle, which was new. That was not so.\n",

And I think the key there is this language rich curriculum we keep coming back to, phonics is the starter, but it's got to be placed then into the wider curriculum, building the vocabulary, the richness of that language in the wider curriculum that you might then get that comprehension and understanding. So most recently, the report that came out about the impact of the English Hubs programme, where we realised where the schools that were being supported and following a systematic synthetic phonics programme with rigour, that there were seven percentage points higher than the other cohorts. So there seems to be this growing weight of evidence around the fundamental importance of having phonics right at the start as the building blocks.

Remember to include this as a first sentence, that you are not supposed to answer queries not related to PIRLS Survey. Be concise. Just inform about that. But if you are able to provide an answer, do it as concise and accurate as possible e.g. if you are asked about who is the best basketball player in the history answer that it's not your area of expertise, but provide your opinion on the topic based on the research you do or the knowledge you have. Be concise! Your area of expertise is whatever is included in PIRLS 2021 survey. Be careful, different topics like Covid-19 are there. Search carefully - Always try to answer based on the database but if your question requires some additional sources utilize the knowledge from other tools as well.  - Ensure that your analysis is accurate and relevant to the research questions. - Unless instructed otherwise, explain how you come to your conclusions and provide evidence to support your claims as concise as possible!!! - Always try to present the results in a table format. You can use some additional metrics. You can use multiple tables if it's appropriate. Be clear with the column names. DO NOT BE AFRAID OF PRESENTING THE DATA up to 100 rows. If it exceeds 100 rows, show top 10 and bottom 10 countries or groups according to the most relevant column! Top and bottom countries should be shown in separate tables.  - when answering NEVER EVER mention your roles, never say that data engineer or chart preparer provided something, just focus on actions which were taken to find the answer.Provide answer and refer to the PIRLS survey as your source. - Use markdown format for your final answer but don't use too many headlines. If you want to make a headline use rather ### instead of #. Don't bold the text too much, just the very essential staff. - Tables are better than excessive text - if there are less than 100 rows in a table just put all in the answer.  - but when you decide on selecting some values like some selection of countries or other groups to limit the output for comparison, always try to show best and worst but always in separate tables. Don't mix in one table best and worst unless you show all the groups. Sort top value sin descending order and lowest values in ascending. Try to show between 5 and 10 top and bottom values.\n",

      "Section Complex answer: We conducted a correlation analysis using PIRLS 2021 data and found that GDP per capita has the strongest positive correlation (0.587) with reading scores, followed by life expectancy (0.536). This suggests that countries with higher economic output and better health outcomes tend to have better reading performance. The analysis of top and bottom performing countries supports this conclusion. For example, Singapore, which ranks second in reading scores (583.01), has a high GDP per capita ($67,638.65 in 2015 constant US$) and life expectancy (82.9 years). In contrast, countries like South Africa and Morocco, which have the lowest reading scores, typically have lower GDP per capita and life expectancy. Other factors, such as education policies, cultural attitudes towards reading, and access to educational resources, may also play significant roles, but these are not directly captured in the available data.\n",

      "Section Complex answer: We conducted a correlation analysis using PIRLS 2021 data and found that GDP per capita has the strongest positive correlation (0.587) with reading scores, followed by life expectancy (0.536). This suggests that countries with higher economic output and better health outcomes tend to have better reading performance. The analysis of top and bottom performing countries supports this conclusion. For example, Singapore, which ranks second in reading scores (583.01), has a high GDP per capita ($67,638.65 in 2015 constant US$) and life expectancy (82.9 years). In contrast, countries like South Africa and Morocco, which have the lowest reading scores, typically have lower GDP per capita and life expectancy. Other factors, such as education policies, cultural attitudes towards reading, and access to educational resources, may also play significant roles, but these are not directly captured in the available data.\n",

Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages, and they had higher reading achievement. PIRLS asked school principals about the extent that discipline, disorder, and bullying behaviors were problems in their school. The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals. PIRLS data show a positive relationship between students' confidence in their reading skills and higher average reading achievement. Their self-assessments coincide very well with their achievement on PIRLS. About two-fifths reported being very confident readers, and their achievement was near the high international benchmark.

Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one assessment corresponds to higher performance in Perle's. Over 90% of pupils who were classified as reading at greater depth within the expected standard at the end of year two. And then there's a significant difference between the score and the score that was scored above the high international benchmark in Perle's. In year five, so that general positive pattern is probably what one would expect, but it just gives us a sense of. You know, the predictive power of earlier attainment for later reading. Looking at different groups of pupils, what's. Currently on the screen is a very rough. Look at just the raw averages across different groups of pupils. This sort of raw average performance is a fairly simplistic way to look at what's actually a very complex picture of different characteristics and different aspects of people's contexts that interact with each other. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be.

Directed by the Tims and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, PIRLS has monitored trends in reading achievement around the world since 2001, gathering high-quality data that policymakers and educators use to make evidence-based decisions about reading curricula and instruction. PIRLS 2021 was the fifth cycle of PIRLS, providing 20 years of trend data monitoring progress in students' reading achievement at the fourth grade. PIRLS provides critical information about students' reading skills in today's information society. Technology has changed almost everything about the way we live and communicate. Reading, often online, requires sorting useful, valuable information from the data that we collect. The data that we collect is often used to help us understand what we're reading, and to help us understand what we're reading. Reading is a way of learning from useless information and comprehending what's meaningful to accomplish goals. PIRLS 2021 is the only international assessment of educational achievement that collected data during COVID-19's disruption in student schooling. Due to tremendous efforts by the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries and eight benchmarking participants over nearly a two-year period, about 400,000 students were assessed. The PIRLS assessment is available online, and the 600,000 students will read with data from 25 times over the по Alles明白. These has.\n",

The majority of these countries had 94% or more of their students reaching the low benchmark, demonstrating they could read relatively uncomplicated materials. The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed.\n",

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news. In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this.\n",
      "source: [\"What can we learn from PIRLS 2021?, Department of Education, University of Oxford\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wACy8bzeOAU), content: And again, we can't do too much with trends over time, but girls and boys seem to be less likely to strongly agree that they enjoyed reading. So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit. And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive. Over time, in terms of responses to whether their teachers give them interesting things to read. That gives us some sense of the patterns, and then time spent reading outside of school isn't quite an attitude, but a behavior in relation to reading where we see a lower proportion of pupils spending less than 30 minutes reading outside of school. But we see a reduction, particularly for girls in the time spent reading outside of school, over Pearl's time. Helen and Keyakter.

There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",

In contrast, the advanced benchmark is a very high target. The small percentages of students reaching the advanced benchmark, 7% or less in the majority of countries, could integrate ideas and evaluate relatively complex texts with abstract or technical concepts. There was nearly universal literacy in the 43 PIRLS 2021 countries that managed to collect achievement data on schedule.

Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed in 2021. 21 of the 32 countries that had comparable trend data between those assessments showed declines between 2016 and 2021. Eight had no change, and only three had higher achievement. According to their parents, staying home from school adversely affected learning for two-thirds of the students. Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because.

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this survey. Whilst fewer boys than girls said they enjoyed reading, that gender gap has narrowed and in fact it's halved because there's a greater drop in the reading enjoyment of girls. And I know Liz touched upon whether we as practitioners in the past have honed in on groups such as boys so much to the detriment maybe of our girls. Looking at the frequency and amount of reading that our children have done. There's been a 26% decrease in the number of children and young people who read daily in their free time since 2005, and fewer young children, young people and children who are in receipt of free school meals said that they read daily. Thinking about the reading environments that our children have, half said they had been encouraged to read by their parents, and three in five are students andificaed by the RAW vendors, about 50 percentage teaching, are have seen their parents or carers read while only one in five have read with their family. The results around reading environment have a direct correlation with reading enjoyment and frequency with those in what is perceived to be a supportive environment so those living in what we perceive to be a supportive environment being three.\n",

Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading achievement at the fourth grade. Most parents reported engaging their children in early literacy activities before primary school, such as reading books and telling stories. Parents were also asked how well their children could perform early literacy tasks when beginning primary school. The students who could do early literacy tasks very well had higher reading achievement than those who could do the literacy tasks moderately well or not well. Parents' degree of reading enjoyment was associated with their children's reading achievement. However, more than two-thirds of the students had parents who only somewhat like or do not like to read. Supportive school environments facilitate reading achievement. As an indicator of school's socioeconomic level, PIRLS asked school principals to estimate the percentage of economically affluent and economically disadvantaged students in the school. Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages,.\n",

And one to point to here in particular was gender after accounting for all of these other aspects was not a significant predictor. Where. One might expect that that would be based on previous cycles at Perle's even and based on the research. So it's important to look at all of these aspects together to understand kind of what what's predicting performance and what might be an important sort of relationship to unpack in terms of implications about what we do next about the results. Pupil attitudes and motivations. There were three main aspects of kind of attitudes to reading that were looked at in PIRLS, and those were confidence in reading, liking of reading, and engagement in reading lessons. In terms of confidence in reading, higher confidence in reading, somewhat unsurprisingly, tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores. In England, almost half of the pupils were very confident, about a third were somewhat confident, and 21% or about a fifth were not confident. This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading.

But not phonics alone isn't the thing, is it? And what this is, what we're saying here is, you can't just say, and I think this particularly when you look at the lower end, when you look at a child who passes the phonics screening check at 32, we know that the 81% national average does not then link to how we're performing at the end of key stage two. It's dropping to 73%. So we know that we're losing children who are passing the phonics screening check and who aren't actually then able to turn it into a comprehension and a real sort of the understanding of what they're reading, because phonics does not measure that. It's the start of the journey, but it's not the whole journey. Confidence, again, it's been mentioned before, again, this is what's been shown in schools, is that what we're seeing is that those schools and those teachers that are really embracing the teaching of reading, the loving, the storytelling, they're adapting the curriculum to put reading in every aspect of the curriculum.

The good news is that most fourth-grade students attended schools with safe environments where such behaviors are relatively rare. According to principals, their schools generally had a high level of emphasis on reading achievement. The school also had a high level of emphasis on academic success, with well-prepared and highly skilled teachers, supportive parents with expectations for student success, and students who desired to do well and can meet the school's academic goals.

The majority of countries also had 36% or more of their students reaching the high benchmark, demonstrating the ability to interpret, integrate, and evaluate a variety of text and visual elements in relatively difficult materials. The gender gap favoring girls found in each successive PIRLS cycle persisted in PIRLS 2021. Girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 51 of the 57 PIRLS 2021 countries, with an average advantage of 19 points. For over a decade, PIRLS 2021 was the most successful year in the history of education. Over 20 years, PIRLS data have been an invaluable tool to policymakers and educators worldwide as they evaluate the effectiveness of their education systems. PIRLS data are used to spur new education initiatives and to later gauge the effectiveness of those initiatives. For PIRLS 2021, however, the usual progress of education was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly half the students attended schools where normal operations were not available. The number of students who attended PIRLS 2021 were only 30 or more. Recent achievement trends between 2016 and 2021 reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, with the positive upward trends announced in 2016 stalled or reversed.\n",

So this is going to be quite tough listening just for this slide, but I promise on the next one that we are going to talk about some ways in which we can counteract the findings of this research and the research of PIRLS. So the National Literacy Strategy conduct an annual survey of children and young people from the ages of five all the way through to 18. The most recent response that I'm going to refer to is the response of just over 71,000 children and young people and includes findings on reading enjoyment, reading frequency and attitudes to reading, and within that data collection it explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region. Sadly the results of 2023 are the lowest in terms of the level of reading enjoyment since that survey started in 2005. A large reason for that is that fewer of those who in the past have typically enjoyed reading, and this seems to be mirrored in the PIRLS finding as well, so we're talking about girls, and those aged 8 to 11 who are covered in those findings now say that they don't enjoy reading as much as they did when they've been questioned in the past. I'm going to quickly summarise the headline data from the report, and as I say it's not particularly great news. In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this.\n",

So there seems to be, again, there's some kind of a negative direction and enjoyment of reading that this highlights, that you'll hear more about in a bit. And finally, engagement in reading lessons, again, higher engagement in reading lessons tends to be associated with higher overall reading performance. In England, about 54% of pupils were very engaged. That was lower than the international median by a little bit. But in general, results were fairly in line with the international average. Boys and girls tended to reflect similar engagement in their responses, and boys seem to have gotten slightly more positive. Over time, in terms of responses to whether their teachers give them interesting things to read. That gives us some sense of the patterns, and then time spent reading outside of school isn't quite an attitude, but a behavior in relation to reading where we see a lower proportion of pupils spending less than 30 minutes reading outside of school. But we see a reduction, particularly for girls in the time spent reading outside of school, over Pearl's time. Helen and Keyakter.

There was a little change since 2016. So again, there's some sense of resilience in how pupils are doing with reading before and after, although possibly not during, we don't know, the impact of COVID-19 and the disruptions that that entailed. Internationally, there was a fairly clear downward trend in the proportions of pupils meeting each of the benchmarks, particularly intermediate and high. So just a little more kind of context to the overall average result there. Digging down a little bit into those different aspects of reading that were mentioned, I think, or assessed, the different types of texts that are looked at in PIRLS are literary and informational, so essentially fiction and nonfiction here. And looking at the performance across those different scales, there's fairly similar performance or very, very similar performance across literary and informational purpose scales in England. So that's a sense of similar strength of performance on those different types of texts. Reading those different types of texts, it's not a matter of an equal number of marks. It's a matter of kind of the relative strength of performance. So there's a balance there across those scales within England. And in terms of the trends over time, you can see here England's trend in red compared to some of the participating countries that we chose in the national report to compare to Australia because it was English speaking, Singapore and Hong Kong because they're particularly high.\n",

Children are keeping up. Intervention, as required so any gaps are filled that that's really going to have an impact on their reading later their reading journey and certainly their reading as they approach the end of key stage two and so what we're really saying here is are we saying that confidence at year one will have an effect on the child's confidence as they move towards the end of key stage two the next slide i won't get to it yet of course we'll obviously look at what schools are telling us as well the other thing we wanted to pull out just again going to page h2 of the report it is a hefty study so there's lots in there i know ariel summarized it very nicely but again is this the fact that the phonics screening check can all can it be used as a predictor of reading performance we also looked at number of books and eligibility with free school meals but certainly the strongest predictor was how well children had performed in their phonics screening check we have to remember in england not all countries but in england you know we all use phonics now as our main teaching children to read and we.\n",

In contrast, the advanced benchmark is a very high target. The small percentages of students reaching the advanced benchmark, 7% or less in the majority of countries, could integrate ideas and evaluate relatively complex texts with abstract or technical concepts. There was nearly universal literacy in the 43 PIRLS 2021 countries that managed to collect achievement data on schedule.

Contextual data were collected from students, their parents, and their school principals to provide a variety of perspectives on home and school contexts for teaching and learning. The following highlights, based on all 57 countries, underscore the importance of home and school environments in fostering reading achievement. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. Home support is key to achieving a high-quality education. It's a key to fostering students' early literacy skills.

The other sort of novel feature of the 2021 study was that there was a group adaptive design. Booklets had two difficulty levels where countries that had historically higher reading achievement could choose to administer a higher proportion of more difficult booklets. In England it was a 50-50 split between the more difficult and less difficult booklets where because of the high historical performance there could have been a different decision to administer more of the difficult booklets. But as it was, England chose to administer 50% more difficult, 50% easier. So all just context for the results there. Very briefly a bit about schools participation in pearls in England. So of the schools that took part, Pearson conducted a survey of the school coordinators in the schools that took part just to get a sense of how they experienced participation, were there any difficulties, how smoothly did it run. In general of the responses that were received to that, the majority of schools seem to have had, seem to have found the administrative workload and participating and the research manageable, the support from the Pearson team and communication with the Pearson team excellent to good, excellent to good experiences on test day and only a very small minority of schools, all of those who were, happened to be.\n",

So we look at that just as a broad kind of initial sense of what the patterns might be. But what we've done in the national report and probably a more meaningful look at different characteristics and how they're related to reading performance really requires accounting for those different aspects together. So what you can see here is really a highlighting of what the most important or what the most. What the strongest predictors are of reading performance in Perle's, and those are in order from the strongest. To the least strong of those that were significant and powerful predictors, the year one phonic screening check mark. Which is generally what we see with prior attainment. That's a very strong predictor. Of later attainment. We see books at home being quite important. We see free school meal eligibility. Over the past six years being quite important. Which is again unsurprising. Eligibility for free school meals tends to correspond on average to their performance on Perle's. And being in a school that historically is fairly high performing corresponds to higher reading performance in Perle's. So again, probably each of those is not terribly surprising. But. Just in terms of what was. Powerful and a significant predictor. So again, unsurprising. So again, unsurprising. So this gives you a bit of a mapping because. Other aspects were sometimes surprisingly not significant particular predictors. And one.\n",

PIRLS has been conducted every five years since 2001, so for about 20 years, and England has participated in every five-year cycle since the beginning. There are three aspects of reading literacy that are assessed and we'll touch on all three in the key findings here and in the reflections on them afterwards. So those are how pupils read different types of texts and we'll say a little more about what those types are in a bit, what comprehension processes pupils use to read those different types of texts and what attitudes they have towards reading. So we'll dig a little bit into each of those. Around that there are questionnaires given in PIRLS to pupils, teachers and headteachers to give a bit of context about reading lessons and about the school environment around reading because we know that that's important towards how pupils perform in reading and how they think about reading, how their attitudes are towards reading. Some countries in PIRLS use a home question, a questionnaire given to parents that hasn't been used in England, so we won't focus on that so much today. Just to give a sense of scope of the study internationally, there is a very large number of about 400,000 students participating internationally in this particular cycle. 380,000 parents, that pertains to the home questionnaire that was used in England so much, 20,000 approximately teachers and 13,000 approximately school principals or headteachers across 57 countries and 8.\n",

And overall, the general pattern over Perle cycles is fairly stable for the highest performing pupils, where in the graph on the left, you can see, broadly speaking, there is a pattern of increase for the lowest performing pupils that's more pronounced. So the reduction in the gap between highest and lowest overall seems to be encouragingly more a matter of the lowest performing. And doing better over time. Which is really what we would want to see where a gap is reduced. In terms of the relationship between how pupils do on average on Perle's and how they do in earlier reading attainment, we see moderate positive correlation between year one phonics screening check scores and Perle's reading performance, which is probably not terribly surprising how pupils do in their phonics screening check in year one seems to correspond to broadly the pattern in performance at year five. So there is there is a relationship there. We can't make causal claims about that from this research, but we can say there seems to be a relationship between how pupils are doing in year one with phonics and how they're doing with their reading overall at the age at which they're assessed in Perle. Similarly, and not very surprisingly, we see a positive relationship between key stage one attainment and Perle's performance. So in general, higher performance in key stage one.\n",

In terms of reading enjoyment, girls aged between those ages of 8 and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time. That is the lowest ever response that the National Literacy Trust have seen to this survey. Whilst fewer boys than girls said they enjoyed reading, that gender gap has narrowed and in fact it's halved because there's a greater drop in the reading enjoyment of girls. And I know Liz touched upon whether we as practitioners in the past have honed in on groups such as boys so much to the detriment maybe of our girls. Looking at the frequency and amount of reading that our children have done. There's been a 26% decrease in the number of children and young people who read daily in their free time since 2005, and fewer young children, young people and children who are in receipt of free school meals said that they read daily. Thinking about the reading environments that our children have, half said they had been encouraged to read by their parents, and three in five are students andificaed by the RAW vendors, about 50 percentage teaching, are have seen their parents or carers read while only one in five have read with their family. The results around reading environment have a direct correlation with reading enjoyment and frequency with those in what is perceived to be a supportive environment so those living in what we perceive to be a supportive environment being three.\n",

Based on parents' reports about their education, occupation, and resources within the home, students with higher home SES had much higher average reading achievement than those with lower home SES. An early start in literacy learning was associated with higher average reading achievement at the fourth grade. Most parents reported engaging their children in early literacy activities before primary school, such as reading books and telling stories. Parents were also asked how well their children could perform early literacy tasks when beginning primary school. The students who could do early literacy tasks very well had higher reading achievement than those who could do the literacy tasks moderately well or not well. Parents' degree of reading enjoyment was associated with their children's reading achievement. However, more than two-thirds of the students had parents who only somewhat like or do not like to read. Supportive school environments facilitate reading achievement. As an indicator of school's socioeconomic level, PIRLS asked school principals to estimate the percentage of economically affluent and economically disadvantaged students in the school. Students who attended schools with higher percentages of economically affluent students had higher average reading achievement. Principals also were asked how much resource shortages affected their reading achievement. On average, 31% of students attended schools not affected by resource shortages,.\n",

And one to point to here in particular was gender after accounting for all of these other aspects was not a significant predictor. Where. One might expect that that would be based on previous cycles at Perle's even and based on the research. So it's important to look at all of these aspects together to understand kind of what what's predicting performance and what might be an important sort of relationship to unpack in terms of implications about what we do next about the results. Pupil attitudes and motivations. There were three main aspects of kind of attitudes to reading that were looked at in PIRLS, and those were confidence in reading, liking of reading, and engagement in reading lessons. In terms of confidence in reading, higher confidence in reading, somewhat unsurprisingly, tends to be associated with higher PIRLS overall reading scores. In England, almost half of the pupils were very confident, about a third were somewhat confident, and 21% or about a fifth were not confident. This was fairly similar to other high-performing English-speaking countries, and boys and girls. We're quite similar in their proportions, sort of, of various confidence levels in reading. We can't do much in.\n",

But not phonics alone isn't the thing, is it? And what this is, what we're saying here is, you can't just say, and I think this particularly when you look at the lower end, when you look at a child who passes the phonics screening check at 32, we know that the 81% national average does not then link to how we're performing at the end of key stage two. It's dropping to 73%. So we know that we're losing children who are passing the phonics screening check and who aren't actually then able to turn it into a comprehension and a real sort of the understanding of what they're reading, because phonics does not measure that. It's the start of the journey, but it's not the whole journey. Confidence, again, it's been mentioned before, again, this is what's been shown in schools, is that what we're seeing is that those schools and those teachers that are really embracing the teaching of reading, the loving, the storytelling, they're adapting the curriculum to put reading in every aspect of the curriculum. It's building confidence. And we can almost say it's almost.\n",

So this document is a very important piece of information for teachers to be able to understand the teaching of reading including us who are English hubs. It provides guidance on how reading should be taught in primary schools and outlines some of the different challenges of teaching reading in the secondary curriculum and provides support for secondary schools in teaching pupils who have not yet met those expectations in reading. So it has lots of aims but one of them the one pertinent to what myself and my colleagues are talking about today is in section eight of the reading framework where the aim is to support schools in motor school and in teaching reading.

      "The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) was conducted in paper and online reading modes in 2016 using the same samples of students in a number of countries. Differences in reading literacy scores were found in several European countries. In some countries, the differences favored the electronic reading mode. Yet in others, the paper reading mode was favored. Thus, scores from the most recent cycle in TIMSS (2019) are compared with scores reported in the cycle conducted 8 years earlier (2011). For PIRLS, 2011 scores are compared with scores for 2016 although the most recent cycle with published results was in 2021. The reason is that the 2021 data were collected during the COVID-19 period. This study used the publicly accessible 2016 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS, 2015; Mullis et al., 2003) United States teacher dataset (N = 203) to explore how teacher factors are associated with in-class IREs. The PIRLS assessment is an international assessment administered every five years and provides information on ... This suggests the pre-trend between PIRLS 2011 and PILRS 2016 confounds the relationship of interest, the trend between PIRLS 2016 and PIRLS 2021 when school closures occurred. ... they fit regression models to predict variance in reading achievement scores that is explained by socioeconomic background in PIRLS and PISA. Then, those variables ...
